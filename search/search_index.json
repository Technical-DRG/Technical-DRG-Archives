It's often compared unfavorably to the base auto cannon, and simply dismissed as useless. In this build breakdown I will be showing why this is an unfair comparison, and why for me bullet hell ranks as in the top 5 overclocks for gunner primaries. Why Bullet Hell? \u00b6 Bullet hell on the surface looks like an absolutely terrible overclock. It removes a TON of base damage from your bullets, and adds a probability based ricochet for one additional target to your bullet. It also comes with the largest accuracy penalty of any overclock. Base bullet hell with no other mods selected is basically unusable. Bullet hell trades direct single target damage for utility. It is up to the player to make the most of that utility to outweigh the downsides of the OC. This is why I personally find bullet hell the most fun OC to play, it gives a lot of outlets for creative play, and rewards you for coming up with interesting ways to use it. TL;DR Offense Hot bullets build: 322X3 Defensive Aggressive Venting build: 322X1 Tier 1 \u00b6 This first option is an extreme no brainer. Bullet hell has such an absurd accuracy penalty that you need to pick option 3 Improved Platform Stability in order to get back to a weapon that somewhat feels like a minigun and not the end of a sparkler. The other options are not even worth discussing. Verdict Pick T1C Improved Platform Stability . Tier 2 \u00b6 Normally a personal choice tier. I would argue that on Bullet Hell you lose that choice and you have to take High Velocity Rounds +2 damage to help offset the massive -3 damage from bullet hell. Looking this mod as a percentage. Taking bullet hell lowers your damage by -3, which brings the base gun down from 10 to 7. You can now either take 600 ammo bumping your total ammo pool from 2400 to 3000 (25%). Or you can take +2 damage and bring your damage from 7 to 9 (~29%). More importantly is breakpoints. With the ammo mod your breakpoints are going to suffer immensely. You are going to hit more armor since you are breaking it less often, and get more reduced damage shots on your already lower damage bullets. I did some tests on common ricochet targets below to show the breakpoints (median of three tests): Enemy T2A More Ammo T2B High Velocity Rounds Swarmer 3 2 Grunt 17-20 13-15 Slasher 30 22 Guard 54 41 Acid Spitter 22 18 Web Spitter 8 6 As you should be able to see, by taking damage you are saving roughly 20%-33% ammo, which means by taking the damage mod not only can you kill things much faster, spending less time on each enemy, but you save more ammo too. There is 0 reason to take the ammo mod with bullet hell. Verdict Pick T2B High Velocity Rounds . Tier 3 \u00b6 This is where most people make their first huge mistake and go for Blowthrough Rounds . Usually this is a good choice on almost any build. However damage per bullet is not the draw of Bullet Hell, so making your bullets potentially hit one more target in a straight line is a very meager benefit. The strength of bullet hell is that you have more bullets per bullet... so this means you get extra proc chances and status effect spread (stun, armor break, hot bullets) on each shot. Improved Stun is the pick on this tier, that basically makes the entire overclock worthwhile. The stun duration triples, and you will be dishing out enough stuns to stunlock about 20 enemies at the same time. Another hidden benefit of this mod is that it keeps enemies off your back just enough that you have more time than usual to let the gun cool while kiting. Since you do not have the luxury of cooling on tier 1, stun helps you manage your heat level much more effectively. Hardened Rounds is an OK choice for non-modded game play if you want to play with bullet hell on hazard 5. If you find yourself not being overwhelmed by enemies too often, you can swap from stun to armor break to increase your damage. Since you cannot control where the bullets hit enemies, ensuring that they can reliably break armor increases your overall damage significantly. Verdict Pick T3B Improved Stun . Tier 4 \u00b6 This tier offers the first real choice, which depends on your personal preference. Variable Chamber Pressure is a good option to help bring your damage up. With this and damage on t2, you actually dish out quite a bit of total DPS counting both the main bullet and the bounced bullet. Assuming 90% player accuracy, and ignoring the tier 1 rate of fire mod it's the build with the 5th most DPS you can get on the minigun. Lighter Barrel Assembly is another great option. This lowers your reaction time required to start stunning things which makes it better at dealing with getting overrun. Another good reason to run this mod is if you frequently find yourself needing to cool enough that the gun starts spinning down. Since the gun cools slower the hotter it is, if you get to the very top of the heat meter before letting it cool, the gun will spin down before you should start firing again. Magnetic Bearings is entirely useless. There is 0 reason to ever pick it. Personally I take Variable Chamber Pressure . All of the issues that Lighter Barrel Assembly fix can also be fixed by improving your skills. Don't heat your gun past 85%, if it does you need to work on your kiting and situational awareness. Prespinning your gun when you expect to get into a fight is sufficient 99% of the time. Verdict Pick T4A Variable Chamber Pressure . Tier 5 \u00b6 This is where the choice in playstyle comes in. You can opt to play defensive , brawling, closer range with aggressive venting. Or a more long range , offensive style with hot bullets. Aggressive Venting is extremely powerful with bullet hell. Bullet hell and stun keep enemies piling up near you as they swarm in without quite killing them. You often need to flick around to hit things directly that are not getting stunned, making it difficult to finish off targets. This pairs perfectly with aggressive venting, making a dense pile of damaged enemies nearby to hit with the vent. The vent will wipe out everything smaller than a guard and clear out a ton of space for you to reposition. Aggressive venting also helps mitigate another of bullet hell's weaknesses: being ammo starved. If vent connects with a big swarm it can do massive damage, if the fleeing / burning bugs retreat into a choke point, fire can spread to additional bugs doing a ton of extra damage and outright killing all swarmers trying to come through that chokepoint. Hot Bullets is probably the meta pick for 6x2 on almost any minigun build, and unsurprisingly it goes great with bullet hell as well. You lose out on the personal safety of aggressive venting, and gain huge offensive power. Stunning a wall of grunts and igniting all of the guards and slashers can do a lot of damage. Stun and hot bullets work in tandem to ignite a target and stun other nearby targets. This results in very effective fire spread. The lower damage of bullet hell here actually helps in a way, preventing ignited targets from dying too quickly to spread heat to their neighbors. In sandbox (terrible terrain to fight with bullet hell) with hot bullets, stun, and bullet hell I can beat 100 hazard 6 slashers at once so it's not terrible at defense, just not as good as aggressive venting. The combination of fire spread, stun, and kiting is enough to keep them just in the sweet spot where they can't quite get you before burning to death. The other huge benefit of hot bullets is the ability to ignite distant targets to then use volatile bullets bulldog on. The margin for error is much thinner than aggressive venting, if you accidentally overheat you are in big trouble. Beating 100 Hazard 6 slashers at once via fire spread from Hot Bullets, stun and kiting. Cold as the grave is a trap option. The other two options on t5 are significantly better for any build, and this is compounded by bullet hell doing very little damage outside of hot bullets or aggressive venting. Typically on reviews for bullet hell where the conclusion is that it is bad, they pick cold as the grave. Verdict Pick T5A Aggressive Venting for a more defensive / close-quarters playstyle. Pick T5C Hot Bullets for a more aggressive / longer-range playstyle. Summary of the Two Options \u00b6 With all of this said we can divide the good bullet hell builds into 2: Offense Hot bullets build: 322X3 ; and Defensive Aggressive Venting build: 322X1 . Secondary and Grenades \u00b6 The strongest secondaries are ones that will round out your build with high direct single target damage. It's also important to note that you do NOT want a secondary that will be used for a long period of time. You don't want the gun cooling too much with hot bullets, typically you will ignite a target and swap to bulldog, take a few shots and swap back to keep your heat in the red. With aggressive venting, you only have 5 seconds of downtime after a vent, you want to be back on minigun firing as soon as you can to begin building up the heat meter again. This means BRT in general is a bad choice since it typically requires a lot of time to have any impact. The coilgun is in the same boat since it requires charging before firing. Coilgun is in a weird place balance wise though, its hard not to recommend 222x3 Hellfire with any primary since its so powerful, but it doesn't really compliment bullet hell very well so I will ignore it. For the Hot Bullets build I use 2332X Volatile Bullets bulldog. This lets you ignite and snipe things from across the map, combined with bullet hell's ability to quickly find and kill leeches in the dark this build is extremely efficient at clearing out a new cave solo. For the Aggressive Venting build solo I will usually take 2332X Elephant Rounds . Aggressive Venting usually won't ignite most targets you would want to hit with volatile bullets like praetorians, or oppressors. Instead you can just rely on the fear and good old elephant rounds to deal with big targets. For grenades if I am taking Volatile Bullets I will take incendiary grenades for the extra ignition source. Sometimes you just don't have the time to wait for your gun to heat up enough to ignite something, or you have a lot of small targets around a big one you want to hit with volatile bullets. The incendiary grenade can also be taken with volatile bullets and aggressive venting if you use it primarily as a source of ignition for large targets such as praetorians and oppressors. Though this still won't help you with longer range targets. As always, you can take cluster grenades if you are good with them, they are much higher immediate impact grenades than incendiary. You can even take them with hot bullets and volatile bullets if you want an additional source of stun instead of an extra ignition source. It's hard to go wrong with incendiary or cluster grenades both are extremely powerful. Playstyle and Tips \u00b6 Bullet hell is a very aggressive playstyle, with either hot bullets or aggressive venting. Most of your damage is coming from fire in one form or another, so positioning and heat management is even more important than it is for other minigun builds. In addition bullet hell adds a lot of utility to your kit which should not be ignored. You almost exclusively want to fight in small corridors and hallways. Fighting out in the open is death. You lose all the benefit of heat and fire spread if the bugs can separate out and stay far away from one another. The minigun cools slower the hotter it is. In order to stay in the red and keep hot bullets online you should aim to keep your heat hovering around 75%-85%. This keeps it at the perfect cooling speed to kite. Keep firing up to 85% heat, stop firing, turn toward the direction oyou want to go, jump and flick your aim back toward the enemies, start firing and the gun should roughly be at 75% heat again. This rhythm will also keep your gun full spun up most of the time for the 15% damage bonus. See DRG - hot bullets/stun/bullet hell vs 100 slashers for a demonstration. With aggressive venting, stun enemies in such a way that they make an arc you can move into, you want the bugs to surround you right as you vent. The playstyle with aggressive venting is very aggressive. Learn how much time it takes to vent from anywhere on the heat meter so you know when to start wading into the bugs to get the optimal vent off. Venting causes massive fear which is not only great for personal safety, but if you can force bugs to retreat through a small chokepoint they will do massive damage with heat spread to other bugs, and also you can now hold the chokepoint again. Bullet hell is the ultimate leech killer. Even from outside a cave entrance you can often times accidentally find and kill leeches. Flick bullets over the ceiling randomly to find leeches quickly. Using Bullet Hell to scan for leeches Bullet hell can be used to find enemies around a corner that do not have line of sight on you. This can often be useful for sniping an acid spitter before it even sees you. It is often worth it to shoot a few bullets at a dark corner or unknown area to find threats. If no health bars pop up that area is empty. With hot bullets your target priority is a little different than normal minigun. Deal with high threat low HP targets as normal, such as web and acid spitters. Most other threats however can be stunned and left alone such as slashers and trijaws. Instead you want to stun and ignite them and then move on to another target. Your goal isn't to kill bugs with bullets, it's to set as many bugs on fire as possible. This also means tanky bugs are a great target such as guards, since they will ignite and burn for a long time while presenting a very low threat. Aggressive venting will often times knock down stalactites from the ceiling seemingly way too far away. When clearing out a PE or Refinery mission cave initially, bullet hell can be used to gather up bugs like normal all around you. If you stand under some stalactites the vent will cause fire fear and a rain of death from above. Using Aggressive Venting to knock down stalactites Bullet hell can stun things behind you. Depending on your situation you can often rely on bullet hell to stun enemies behind you without looking. This is a huge boon on your attention economy letting you focus on the enemies that matter more. This clip shows one case where I identified the number of enemies coming in from behind me was low, so I let bullet hell bounces deal with it while I built up heat for an aggressive vent on the oppressor. VODs \u00b6 Assorted videos using Bullet Hell on Hazard 6x2: Isn't it just the base auto cannon but worse? \u00b6 Incoming Rant No. Not even remotely. This is a common opinion of spreadsheet jockeys that look at the damage numbers and conclude that it just \"turns the minigun into a weak autocannon\" since it can only hit 2-3 targets per bullet. They then take it into missions using blowthrough and cold as the grave, and play it exactly like the autocannon, as uncreativly as possible and conclude that its a bad autocannon. Thinking about bullet hell for even a few seconds should be enough to realize this isn't true. Autocannon can't hit enemies behind you. Autocannon, can't shoot around corners. Autocannon can't seek out and kill all leeches in a massive cave in seconds. Autocannon doesn't stun. Autocannon has horrific accuracy and anything farther away than 20m is might as well be out of range. Splash from autocannon doesn't do weakpoint damage. The autocannon can't apply heat, the most overpowered status effect in the game. At this point I'm tired of coming up with things and listing them, I'm sure I could keep going for a lot longer. In general the autocannon is not a flexible weapon. And lacks a coherent, smooth combat loop. The minigun by comparison is fantastically flexible and has a well designed (probably on accident) combat loop. The main reason the the autocannon performs well in the vanilla game, and to some extent starship troopers one of the more popular \"difficulty\" mods, is low enemy variety. The AC excels at killing non-vetran grunts. And haz <=5 provides basic grunts coming at you slowly from one direction in spades. This weak enemy composition does not force you to split your attention and will not punish mistakes. Once you get to hazard 6+ levels of enemy variety the autocannon falls off a massive cliff. The bugs are faster, and the quantities mean they spread out and flank you much more often. The autocannon struggles to even deal with grunts in modded difficulty because of the increased speed and variety. Guards will regularly make it through to you, blocking tons of shots that would normally be hitting slashers and grunts. They can force you back much more effectively, and split your attention dealing with flanking grunts, costing you a lot of time retreating and then taking back space after the wave is over. On haz 6+ this is pretty much a death sentence. Simply by taking the minigun over the autocannon you can mitigate almost all of these problems. The ability to stun enemies is huge. For example, if a menace spawns 20m away autocannon needs to seek cover, or blow a shield. Minigun will flick to it until the stun icon pops up (usually a fraction of a second) and then go back to ignoring it. This can usually be done in your normal kiting cycle while in the air from a bunny hop and costs almost nothing. The larger the enemy variety the worse the disparity between economy of attention gets. The autocannon just can't deal with anything that isn't grunts in an time efficient way. Whereas the minigun with stun can easily shift focus to deal with something in a fraction of a second, and shift back. Now when you take bullet hell on the stun minigun, you don't even need to aim at the threats you want to stun. You just need to aim near them. Over the course of a swarm this results in a huge savings of attention that normally you would need to spend on special threats. One of the biggest advantages of bullet hell is having all of this free attention to reinvest during a swarm. In that regard I would actually argue that autocannon and bullet hell are polar opposites. Now lets consider another issue with hazard 6x2. Increased stationary enemies. Autocannon SUCKS at breaking into a fresh cave. Its bad accuracy means it can't at all deal with spitballers and breeders at a distance, and even leeches are iffy since your rounds can go right past their grasping arm even at point blank. It sucks at dealing with naedocytes. The minigun again deals with all of this better. You can easily pick off spitballers using the weakpoint, and shoot down the spitballer projectiles. You can laser focus on the breeder weakpoint and shoot down all the naedocytes. Bullet hell improves this even more by adding the ability to quickly check for leeches without needing light, and mopping up naedocytes and swarmers without even needing to look at them. This means you can now escape into an unexplored cave without needing to gamble on a leech not being present. With hot bullets and volatile bullets a minigunner can empty a cave of threats very rapidly, whereas the autocannon is at the mercy of the cave generation to give it small caves to clear. On top of all of this the autoacannon has a bad combat loop, and poor synergy with secondary weapons. The autocannon is designed as a crowd clearing AoE weapon. This holds up fine on hazard 5 even up to double enemies. However the downside is the 5 second mandatory reload you can't get around. During this time the gun is non functional, the only damage it can deal is toxin you have previously already set with Neurotoxin Payload. Without the enemy speed buffs and numbers, on haz 4/5 you tend to get a trickle of trash enemies, then a few slow praetorians behind that are easy to kill in isolation. This is not the case in haz 6x2, the grunts are constant, and the praetorians will be a part of their wave which means you need to deal with them at the same time as the grunts. In tunnels their acid spray can actually be dangerous. If you do not clear them quickly more will catch up and start spraying till you wind up with 5-6 praetorians 2-3 oppressors all mixed in with grunts. In tight spaces this is a death sentence. Whether or not you have time to reload is almost entirely a matter of luck or burning shields. A damage oriented minigun build can clear them itself just fine, and bullet hell with elephant rounds or volatile bullets can stunlock and execute them with no problem. You also tend to be up close and brawling anyway since you are trying to maximize aggressive venting, which makes weaving in power attacks easier. Crowd control autocannon builds will struggle and eventually get zoned off with too many acid/oppressor attacks going off and get killed by a spitter or slasher. To combat this you need to take fear to turn praetorians around, and elephant rounds to kill them quickly. Now the issue is that on haz 6x2 you don't have that freedom, since when you are reloading you are completely helpless and will be killed or heavily damaged in that 5 seconds without a strong crowd control secondary such as hellfire, electro mines or maybe explosive magic bullets. The minigun gets around this by covering for itself while overheating with aggressive venting. The damage and space that venting creates is as if you never stopped firing, in may cases its actually a lot stronger than if you had just been firing that whole time. Combined dash/vent/stun/bullet hell/shield is a perfect combat loop with plenty of survival and tools that all chain together smoothly. You don't need any other tools which frees your secondary slot up to pick elephant rounds or volatile bullets to finish off the build and handle any threat. On top of all that, the minigun also has the option of just not overheating. You are in charge of your heat buildup and can change your firing rhythm to control when, or if you overheat at all. Now... lets talk about consistency. On hazard 6x2 the wave timer is extremely tight. Only giving you 1-2 minutes at at time without a wave or swarm. Relying on the autocannon to clear takes a lot of time, even with its strongest OCs. Neurotoxin requires a lot of waiting around for the damage over time to kill things. And Big Bertha requires you to be in a state of perpetual reload since the magazine is so small. You spend a lot of time kiting backwards away from spawns waiting to reload or for them to die to toxin. Once you manage to clear and push forward the next wave is often times spawning, trapping you in a perpetual loop of combat. Minigun with stun and aggressive venting can much more consistently push into and through a swarm to get to the other side. Using a shield to collect nitra in the next room if needed. The autocannon will usually need that shield to push through in the first place. In general this means the minigun can complete runs more consistently than the autocannon because you can breach into caves faster, spend less time running from swarms, and generally are quicker. This is not all saying the autocannon is unusable. Its just a much worse designed weapon than the minigun. With sufficient skill with kiting, and some luck you can make it work solo. And on teams NTP is very usable, but its still just a weak version of sticky fuel driller. You are always better of bringing sticky fuel and a minigun over NTP. Minigun will always give you more flexibility and options in any given situation.","title":"Bullet Hell"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#build-breakdoown-bullet-hell-gunners-lead-storm-overclock-modded-hazard-6x2","text":"Post Info Author u/Shotgun-Crocodile Post Date 2022-07-26 Original Post Link BUILD BREAKDOWN: Bullet Hell (Gunner's Lead Storm) [MODDED: Haz6x2] Bullet hell is probably one of the most widely disparaged overclocks in the game.

It removes a TON of base damage from your bullets, and adds a probability based ricochet for one additional target to your bullet. It also comes with the largest accuracy penalty of any overclock. Base bullet hell with no other mods selected is basically unusable. Bullet hell trades direct single target damage for utility. It is up to the player to make the most of that utility to outweigh the downsides of the OC. This is why I personally find bullet hell the most fun OC to play, it gives a lot of outlets for creative play, and rewards you for coming up with interesting ways to use it.

Bullet hell has such an absurd accuracy penalty that you need to pick option 3 Improved Platform Stability in order to get back to a weapon that somewhat feels like a minigun and not the end of a sparkler. The other options are not even worth discussing. Verdict Pick T1C Improved Platform Stability .","title":"Tier 1"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#tier-2","text":"Normally a personal choice tier. I would argue that on Bullet Hell you lose that choice and you have to take High Velocity Rounds +2 damage to help offset the massive -3 damage from bullet hell. Looking this mod as a percentage. Taking bullet hell lowers your damage by -3, which brings the base gun down from 10 to 7. You can now either take 600 ammo bumping your total ammo pool from 2400 to 3000 (25%). Or you can take +2 damage and bring your damage from 7 to 9 (~29%). More importantly is breakpoints. With the ammo mod your breakpoints are going to suffer immensely. You are going to hit more armor since you are breaking it less often, and get more reduced damage shots on your already lower damage bullets. I did some tests on common ricochet targets below to show the breakpoints (median of three tests): Enemy T2A More Ammo T2B High Velocity Rounds Swarmer 3 2 Grunt 17-20 13-15 Slasher 30 22 Guard 54 41 Acid Spitter 22 18 Web Spitter 8 6 As you should be able to see, by taking damage you are saving roughly 20%-33% ammo, which means by taking the damage mod not only can you kill things much faster, spending less time on each enemy, but you save more ammo too. There is 0 reason to take the ammo mod with bullet hell. Verdict Pick T2B High Velocity Rounds .","title":"Tier 2"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#tier-3","text":"This is where most people make their first huge mistake and go for Blowthrough Rounds . Usually this is a good choice on almost any build. However damage per bullet is not the draw of Bullet Hell, so making your bullets potentially hit one more target in a straight line is a very meager benefit. The strength of bullet hell is that you have more bullets per bullet... so this means you get extra proc chances and status effect spread (stun, armor break, hot bullets) on each shot. Improved Stun is the pick on this tier, that basically makes the entire overclock worthwhile. The stun duration triples, and you will be dishing out enough stuns to stunlock about 20 enemies at the same time. Another hidden benefit of this mod is that it keeps enemies off your back just enough that you have more time than usual to let the gun cool while kiting. Since you do not have the luxury of cooling on tier 1, stun helps you manage your heat level much more effectively. Hardened Rounds is an OK choice for non-modded game play if you want to play with bullet hell on hazard 5. If you find yourself not being overwhelmed by enemies too often, you can swap from stun to armor break to increase your damage. Since you cannot control where the bullets hit enemies, ensuring that they can reliably break armor increases your overall damage significantly. Verdict Pick T3B Improved Stun .","title":"Tier 3"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#tier-4","text":"This tier offers the first real choice, which depends on your personal preference. Variable Chamber Pressure is a good option to help bring your damage up. With this and damage on t2, you actually dish out quite a bit of total DPS counting both the main bullet and the bounced bullet. Assuming 90% player accuracy, and ignoring the tier 1 rate of fire mod it's the build with the 5th most DPS you can get on the minigun. Lighter Barrel Assembly is another great option. This lowers your reaction time required to start stunning things which makes it better at dealing with getting overrun. Another good reason to run this mod is if you frequently find yourself needing to cool enough that the gun starts spinning down. Since the gun cools slower the hotter it is, if you get to the very top of the heat meter before letting it cool, the gun will spin down before you should start firing again. Magnetic Bearings is entirely useless. There is 0 reason to ever pick it. Personally I take Variable Chamber Pressure . All of the issues that Lighter Barrel Assembly fix can also be fixed by improving your skills. Don't heat your gun past 85%, if it does you need to work on your kiting and situational awareness. Prespinning your gun when you expect to get into a fight is sufficient 99% of the time. Verdict Pick T4A Variable Chamber Pressure .","title":"Tier 4"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#tier-5","text":"This is where the choice in playstyle comes in. You can opt to play defensive , brawling, closer range with aggressive venting. Or a more long range , offensive style with hot bullets. Aggressive Venting is extremely powerful with bullet hell. Bullet hell and stun keep enemies piling up near you as they swarm in without quite killing them. You often need to flick around to hit things directly that are not getting stunned, making it difficult to finish off targets. This pairs perfectly with aggressive venting, making a dense pile of damaged enemies nearby to hit with the vent. The vent will wipe out everything smaller than a guard and clear out a ton of space for you to reposition. Aggressive venting also helps mitigate another of bullet hell's weaknesses: being ammo starved. If vent connects with a big swarm it can do massive damage, if the fleeing / burning bugs retreat into a choke point, fire can spread to additional bugs doing a ton of extra damage and outright killing all swarmers trying to come through that chokepoint. Hot Bullets is probably the meta pick for 6x2 on almost any minigun build, and unsurprisingly it goes great with bullet hell as well. You lose out on the personal safety of aggressive venting, and gain huge offensive power. Stunning a wall of grunts and igniting all of the guards and slashers can do a lot of damage. Stun and hot bullets work in tandem to ignite a target and stun other nearby targets. This results in very effective fire spread. The lower damage of bullet hell here actually helps in a way, preventing ignited targets from dying too quickly to spread heat to their neighbors. In sandbox (terrible terrain to fight with bullet hell) with hot bullets, stun, and bullet hell I can beat 100 hazard 6 slashers at once so it's not terrible at defense, just not as good as aggressive venting. The combination of fire spread, stun, and kiting is enough to keep them just in the sweet spot where they can't quite get you before burning to death. The other huge benefit of hot bullets is the ability to ignite distant targets to then use volatile bullets bulldog on. The margin for error is much thinner than aggressive venting, if you accidentally overheat you are in big trouble. Beating 100 Hazard 6 slashers at once via fire spread from Hot Bullets, stun and kiting. Cold as the grave is a trap option. The other two options on t5 are significantly better for any build, and this is compounded by bullet hell doing very little damage outside of hot bullets or aggressive venting. Typically on reviews for bullet hell where the conclusion is that it is bad, they pick cold as the grave. Verdict Pick T5A Aggressive Venting for a more defensive / close-quarters playstyle. Pick T5C Hot Bullets for a more aggressive / longer-range playstyle.","title":"Tier 5"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#summary-of-the-two-options","text":"With all of this said we can divide the good bullet hell builds into 2: Offense Hot bullets build: 322X3 ; and Defensive Aggressive Venting build: 322X1 .","title":"Summary of the Two Options"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#secondary-and-grenades","text":"The strongest secondaries are ones that will round out your build with high direct single target damage. It's also important to note that you do NOT want a secondary that will be used for a long period of time. You don't want the gun cooling too much with hot bullets, typically you will ignite a target and swap to bulldog, take a few shots and swap back to keep your heat in the red. With aggressive venting, you only have 5 seconds of downtime after a vent, you want to be back on minigun firing as soon as you can to begin building up the heat meter again. This means BRT in general is a bad choice since it typically requires a lot of time to have any impact. The coilgun is in the same boat since it requires charging before firing. Coilgun is in a weird place balance wise though, its hard not to recommend 222x3 Hellfire with any primary since its so powerful, but it doesn't really compliment bullet hell very well so I will ignore it. For the Hot Bullets build I use 2332X Volatile Bullets bulldog. This lets you ignite and snipe things from across the map, combined with bullet hell's ability to quickly find and kill leeches in the dark this build is extremely efficient at clearing out a new cave solo. For the Aggressive Venting build solo I will usually take 2332X Elephant Rounds . Aggressive Venting usually won't ignite most targets you would want to hit with volatile bullets like praetorians, or oppressors. Instead you can just rely on the fear and good old elephant rounds to deal with big targets. For grenades if I am taking Volatile Bullets I will take incendiary grenades for the extra ignition source. Sometimes you just don't have the time to wait for your gun to heat up enough to ignite something, or you have a lot of small targets around a big one you want to hit with volatile bullets. The incendiary grenade can also be taken with volatile bullets and aggressive venting if you use it primarily as a source of ignition for large targets such as praetorians and oppressors. Though this still won't help you with longer range targets. As always, you can take cluster grenades if you are good with them, they are much higher immediate impact grenades than incendiary. You can even take them with hot bullets and volatile bullets if you want an additional source of stun instead of an extra ignition source. It's hard to go wrong with incendiary or cluster grenades both are extremely powerful.","title":"Secondary and Grenades"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#playstyle-and-tips","text":"Bullet hell is a very aggressive playstyle, with either hot bullets or aggressive venting. Most of your damage is coming from fire in one form or another, so positioning and heat management is even more important than it is for other minigun builds. In addition bullet hell adds a lot of utility to your kit which should not be ignored. You almost exclusively want to fight in small corridors and hallways. Fighting out in the open is death. You lose all the benefit of heat and fire spread if the bugs can separate out and stay far away from one another. The minigun cools slower the hotter it is. In order to stay in the red and keep hot bullets online you should aim to keep your heat hovering around 75%-85%. This keeps it at the perfect cooling speed to kite. Keep firing up to 85% heat, stop firing, turn toward the direction oyou want to go, jump and flick your aim back toward the enemies, start firing and the gun should roughly be at 75% heat again. This rhythm will also keep your gun full spun up most of the time for the 15% damage bonus. See DRG - hot bullets/stun/bullet hell vs 100 slashers for a demonstration. With aggressive venting, stun enemies in such a way that they make an arc you can move into, you want the bugs to surround you right as you vent. The playstyle with aggressive venting is very aggressive. Learn how much time it takes to vent from anywhere on the heat meter so you know when to start wading into the bugs to get the optimal vent off. Venting causes massive fear which is not only great for personal safety, but if you can force bugs to retreat through a small chokepoint they will do massive damage with heat spread to other bugs, and also you can now hold the chokepoint again. Bullet hell is the ultimate leech killer. Even from outside a cave entrance you can often times accidentally find and kill leeches. Flick bullets over the ceiling randomly to find leeches quickly. Using Bullet Hell to scan for leeches Bullet hell can be used to find enemies around a corner that do not have line of sight on you. This can often be useful for sniping an acid spitter before it even sees you. It is often worth it to shoot a few bullets at a dark corner or unknown area to find threats. If no health bars pop up that area is empty. With hot bullets your target priority is a little different than normal minigun. Deal with high threat low HP targets as normal, such as web and acid spitters. Most other threats however can be stunned and left alone such as slashers and trijaws. Instead you want to stun and ignite them and then move on to another target. Your goal isn't to kill bugs with bullets, it's to set as many bugs on fire as possible. This also means tanky bugs are a great target such as guards, since they will ignite and burn for a long time while presenting a very low threat. Aggressive venting will often times knock down stalactites from the ceiling seemingly way too far away. When clearing out a PE or Refinery mission cave initially, bullet hell can be used to gather up bugs like normal all around you. If you stand under some stalactites the vent will cause fire fear and a rain of death from above. Using Aggressive Venting to knock down stalactites Bullet hell can stun things behind you. Depending on your situation you can often rely on bullet hell to stun enemies behind you without looking. This is a huge boon on your attention economy letting you focus on the enemies that matter more. This clip shows one case where I identified the number of enemies coming in from behind me was low, so I let bullet hell bounces deal with it while I built up heat for an aggressive vent on the oppressor.","title":"Playstyle and Tips"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#vods","text":"Assorted videos using Bullet Hell on Hazard 6x2:","title":"VODs"},{"location":"builds/bullet-hell/#isnt-it-just-the-base-auto-cannon-but-worse","text":"Incoming Rant No. Not even remotely. This is a common opinion of spreadsheet jockeys that look at the damage numbers and conclude that it just \"turns the minigun into a weak autocannon\" since it can only hit 2-3 targets per bullet. They then take it into missions using blowthrough and cold as the grave, and play it exactly like the autocannon, as uncreativly as possible and conclude that its a bad autocannon. Thinking about bullet hell for even a few seconds should be enough to realize this isn't true. Autocannon can't hit enemies behind you. Autocannon, can't shoot around corners. Autocannon can't seek out and kill all leeches in a massive cave in seconds. Autocannon doesn't stun. Autocannon has horrific accuracy and anything farther away than 20m is might as well be out of range. Splash from autocannon doesn't do weakpoint damage. The autocannon can't apply heat, the most overpowered status effect in the game. At this point I'm tired of coming up with things and listing them, I'm sure I could keep going for a lot longer. In general the autocannon is not a flexible weapon. And lacks a coherent, smooth combat loop. The minigun by comparison is fantastically flexible and has a well designed (probably on accident) combat loop. The main reason the the autocannon performs well in the vanilla game, and to some extent starship troopers one of the more popular \"difficulty\" mods, is low enemy variety. The AC excels at killing non-vetran grunts. And haz <=5 provides basic grunts coming at you slowly from one direction in spades. This weak enemy composition does not force you to split your attention and will not punish mistakes. Once you get to hazard 6+ levels of enemy variety the autocannon falls off a massive cliff. The bugs are faster, and the quantities mean they spread out and flank you much more often. The autocannon struggles to even deal with grunts in modded difficulty because of the increased speed and variety. Guards will regularly make it through to you, blocking tons of shots that would normally be hitting slashers and grunts. They can force you back much more effectively, and split your attention dealing with flanking grunts, costing you a lot of time retreating and then taking back space after the wave is over. On haz 6+ this is pretty much a death sentence. Simply by taking the minigun over the autocannon you can mitigate almost all of these problems. The ability to stun enemies is huge. For example, if a menace spawns 20m away autocannon needs to seek cover, or blow a shield. Minigun will flick to it until the stun icon pops up (usually a fraction of a second) and then go back to ignoring it. This can usually be done in your normal kiting cycle while in the air from a bunny hop and costs almost nothing. The larger the enemy variety the worse the disparity between economy of attention gets. The autocannon just can't deal with anything that isn't grunts in an time efficient way. Whereas the minigun with stun can easily shift focus to deal with something in a fraction of a second, and shift back. Now when you take bullet hell on the stun minigun, you don't even need to aim at the threats you want to stun. You just need to aim near them. Over the course of a swarm this results in a huge savings of attention that normally you would need to spend on special threats. One of the biggest advantages of bullet hell is having all of this free attention to reinvest during a swarm. In that regard I would actually argue that autocannon and bullet hell are polar opposites. Now lets consider another issue with hazard 6x2. Increased stationary enemies.

A damage oriented minigun build can clear them itself just fine, and bullet hell with elephant rounds or volatile bullets can stunlock and execute them with no problem. You also tend to be up close and brawling anyway since you are trying to maximize aggressive venting, which makes weaving in power attacks easier.

Arguably his most powerful weapon is the Lead Storm minigun, which can be built for simultaneous massive single target DPS and swarm clear with the confusingly named Lead Storm overclock. This post, however, will focus on a more aggressive playstyle: Burning Hell . All numbers in this post are taken from the Equipment Terminal in-game. TL;DR 12223 or 32221 with Burning Hell are mostly your best options. Pair with Volatile Bullets (Bulldog OC ) for immense weakpoint damage and cluster grenades for a large on-demand area stun. Weapon Heat Crosshair Mod I highly recommend the Weapon Heat Crosshair mod for any minigun build. Why Burning Hell? \u00b6 While Lead Storm (or LSLS) is a very powerful overclock, it requires exceptional positioning skill, decent aim, and is very unforgiving. Burning Hell is a much safer option, and if you can hit your Volatile Bullets shots, you don't lose out on much damage against chunky targets. Burning Hell also has arguably more swarm clear potential than LSLS due to its ability to ignite swarms much quicker and more easily, which allows fire spread to take effect faster. Tier 1 \u00b6 Our options on this tier are: Magnetic Refrigeration , which doubles the minigun's base cooling rate when not firing and reduces the cooling delay after the gun stops firing; Improved Motor , which increases fire rate by 4, to a total of 34 bullets per second (though the minigun's stats notoriously lie and the real firerate would only be 17); and Improved Platform Stability , which reduces the gun's base spread from 100% to 25%. A faster cooling rate makes maintaining Hot Bullets output much easier, as you need to wait for a much shorter time before being able to tap-firing again without overheating. Sadly, the increase in fire rate does not increase the heat produced by the minigun, which means you unfortunately cannot take advantage of either Hot Bullets or Aggressive Venting faster. Increased accuracy is very valuable on any fully automatic weapon. Verdict Take option 1 T1A MAgnetic Refrigeration if you're choosing Hot Bullets on Tier 5. Take option 3 T1C Improved Platform Stability if you're choosing Aggressive Venting on Tier 5. Tier 2 \u00b6 A somewhat boring tier, Oversized Drum adds 600 ammo to our pool, bumping us up to 3000, while High Velocity Rounds increases our damage per bullet by 2, for a total of 12. This is a personal choice, but it's important to note that Hot Bullets is affected by the damage upgrade; a fraction of your total damage is ADDED as heat damage (not converted), and thus you will heat enemies faster if you take the damage mod. Verdict Take either option. T1B High Velocity Rounds is recommended especially if you take Hot Bullets . Tier 3 \u00b6 Now we're getting to the good stuff. Hardened Rounds gives us 200% extra armor break, for a total of 300%. Improved Stun gives us 20% extra Stun chance, for a total of 40%. Blowthrough Rounds gives us one blowthrough penetration per bullet. Armor break on a fully automatic weapon can be very useful, specifically against Shellbacks and Brundles. However, since Burning Hell has low base damage and relies largely on its fire sources to deal its full damage potential, this is not a great pick. Stun helps make an already safe build even safer. It allows you to more reliably get up close to bugs when needed, and also helps ensure that you hit Volatile Bullets shots on targets with small weakpoints, such as Menaces or Wardens. Blowthrough is good on a direct damage build, but again Burning Hell relies on its fire capabilities to do its damage. When playing close to the bugs, you will also typically not be at an angle to make full use of blowthrough. Verdict While this is a personal choice, I strongly recommend option 2 T3B Improved Stun . Tier 4 \u00b6 Another interesting pick. Variable Chamber Pressure gives us a 15% damage boost when the gun is fully stabilized (in other words, when you have reached max fire rate). Lighter Barrel Assembly decreases the spinup time of the minigun from 0.7 to 0.3 seconds, and its opposite, Magnetic Bearings , increases the time the minigun stays spun up by 1 second. A 15% damage boost is nice for optimal damage on a direct damage build, but as mentioned previously, Burning Hell gets much more use out of its fire and heat outputs. You will also almost never be taking advantage of this mod while using your fire cone, as you need to be tap-firing to avoid overheating. Faster spinup helps this build immensely. First, you have a much more immediate reaction to danger and can stun it very quickly if you need to. Second, a faster spinup allows you to keep continually bringing up your fire cone more quickly, increasing your damage output at close range. Honestly, I really don't know why Magnetic Bearings exists. You can manually tap your fire button while not firing to keep the weapon spun up, and the other two options on this tier blow it out of the water. Verdict Take option 1 T4A Variable Chamber Pressure if you think you'll make good use of it, but I recommend taking option 2 T4B Lighter Barrel Assembly . Tier 5 \u00b6 The most drastic playstyle changes found on the minigun are in this tier. Aggressive Venting makes the gun explode when you overheat, producing large amounts of heat damage and Fear in a decent radius around you, while also reducing the recovery time from an overheat in half, to 5 seconds from 10. Cold as the Grave cools the minigun slightly whenever it kills an enemy. Hot Bullets adds 50% of your total damage to the weapon as heat damage. Aggressive Venting is incredibly powerful in solo. Having an on-demand massive Fear bomb that also burns enemies and thus produces fire spread is an extremely safe playstyle. Combined with the quicker ignite that Burning Hell has, you can proc this incredibly quickly and quite often. However, this playstyle isn't as effective in a team, as enemies that are targeting a teammate instead of you will likely not get hit by the vent, and most classes will usually bring a better swarm clear option to the team, rendering AV redundant. Cold as the Grave is a popular choice, but Burning Hell benefits very little from it, and loses out on a lot. I also don't believe that this mod procs when an enemy is killed from Burning Hell's fire cone, which is the largest portion of your damage. Hot Bullets is optimal for team play. It provides quick long range ignition on enemies, which is powerful against Grunt packs because of fire spread, and is useful against tankier HVTS such as Wardens and Menaces that you can finish off with a Volatile Bullets shot or two. Verdict Take option 1 Aggressive Venting if you're running solo or in a team that can ignite far targets for you. Take option 3 Hot Bullets if you're in a team that you trust to deal with trash mobs so that you can focus on igniting targets for Volatile Bullets . Secondary and Grenades \u00b6 As mentioned many times before, Volatile Bullets Bulldog synergizes exceptionally well with this build. It provides massive single target damage that you can easily take advantage of with Hot Bullets. If you're using Aggressive Venting while solo, I would recommend Elephant Rounds instead, as you won't be able to ignite far off targets easily (barring incendiary grenades). Cluster grenades and incendiary grenades are both competitive choices. Sticky grenades, IMO , don't do enough swarm clear on their own for them to be worth it, even with their Fear potential. Clusters can be used to wipe large groups of trash or as an on-demand large area stun button for Mactera. Incendiaries have similar swarm clear to clusters, but they trade the stun potential for an instant ignition source, which can be useful with Volatile Bullets . Playstyle and Tips \u00b6 A Burning Hell Gunner needs to be on the ball with his Volatile Bullets shots. You need to be paying attention to what you and your teammates have ignited, are going to ignite, and which heavy hitting enemies are currently on the playing field. Proper shield placement has a high skill ceiling, but can be highly rewarding. Play close, but not too close. Corral the swarm; don't jump into the middle of it. If you have trash clearing teammates, such as a Sticky Fuel driller, save your ammo and use your fire cone for self defense against Naedocytes, rogue Swarmers, and small Grunt packs. Save the larger clumps for classes who can deal with them more efficiently. Make use of both the cone and Hot Bullets , if you have it. You can b-hop and \"dance\" around slightly in front of a swarm to allow yourself to heat them with the cone while not getting bitten yourself. Pepper each enemy with a couple of shots and let the fire damage do the rest, rather than trying to kill them one by one. If a large Mactera cloud appears, don't focus them down individually until they're dead. Attempt to stun them instead, and keep rotating shots between them. Focus on stunning Trijaws first, as Spawn and Brundles can be kited more easily. Don't feel bad about wasting ammo on Grunts or walls while trying to get to Hot Bullets . The fire status effect and Volatile Bullets will usually make up for the lost damage. This goes for any Gunner playstyle, but try to use shields proactively, rather than reactively. A team of 4 living dwarves can take advantage of a shield much more effectively than 3 dwarves trying to revive someone who died because there wasn't a shield down. Shield before you're overrun, rather than after.","title":"Burning Hell"},{"location":"builds/burning-hell/#build-breakdown-burning-hell-gunners-lead-storm-overclock-modded-hazard-6x2","text":"Post Info Author u/Virryn__ Post Date 2022-05-29 Original Post Link BUILD BREAKDOWN: Burning Hell (Gunner's Lead Storm) [MODDED: Haz6x2] Gunner is a fairly straightforward class compared to the others, but he still has quite a few versatile and flexible builds in his arsenal. Arguably his most powerful weapon is the Lead Storm minigun, which can be built for simultaneous massive single target DPS and swarm clear with the confusingly named Lead Storm overclock.

A faster cooling rate makes maintaining Hot Bullets output much easier, as you need to wait for a much shorter time before being able to tap-firing again without overheating.

However, since Burning Hell has low base damage and relies largely on its fire sources to deal its full damage potential, this is not a great pick. Stun helps make an already safe build even safer. It allows you to more reliably get up close to bugs when needed, and also helps ensure that you hit Volatile Bullets shots on targets with small weakpoints, such as Menaces or Wardens. Blowthrough is good on a direct damage build, but again Burning Hell relies on its fire capabilities to do its damage.

As such, I'll largely be comparing the choices taken with this build to the ones taken previously. An important distinction to make is that Lead Storm requires a much more defensive and aware playstyle, so the mod choices will reflect that. All numbers in this post are taken from the in-game Equipment Terminal (well, technically they were taken from my previous minigun post, which used in-game numbers). TL;DR While many of this build's tiers are subjective, I personally run 32313 in team games, paired with either Hellfire or Volatile Bullets , along with cluster grenades. I highly recommend the Weapon Heat Crosshair mod for any minigun build. Weapon Heat Crosshair Mod Weapon Heat Crosshair Why Lead Storm? \u00b6 Burning Hell is a good option if you want safe and reliable swarm clear while still retaining good ignition potential for Volatile Bullets . But if you want your minigun to feel like a minigun and give it the power to shred through swarms and juicy targets alike, without any of that fire nonsense, Lead Storm is your go-to. While Lead Storm is an unstable overclock, it really only has one penalty: its stun chance and duration are both heavily decreased. Its other negative, 0x movespeed while firing, can be easily nullified if you learn to \"bunny hop\" with the weapon, by jumping, firing, ceasing fire right before you hit the ground, jumping again, and so on. I was asked to also consider A Little More Oomph . A Little More Oomph is a solid pick if you don't expect to be the one pulling 100% of the weight in a team. The slight damage boost is the main draw, though the faster spinup time does also feel nice. Compared to Lead Storm , however, the only real reason to take ALMO over LSLS is to regain stun potential, as Lead Storm 's damage potential is simply much higher and its movement penalty can be effectively removed with enough practice. Tier 1 \u00b6 Our first options are Magnetic Refrigeration , which doubles the minigun's base cooling rate when not firing and reduces the cooling delay after the gun stops firing; Improved Motor , which increases fire rate by 4, to a total of 34 bullets per second (though the minigun's stats notoriously lie and the real firerate would only be 17); and Improved Platform Stability , which reduces the gun's base spread from 100% to 25%. Unlike Burning Hell , Lead Storm does not overheat very quickly. Even with sustained fire, it will be very difficult to overheat it. The main reason to take this mod on Burning Hell is so that you can tap-fire to make use of the damage cone more consistently, but this does not apply to Lead Storm . Sadly, the increase in fire rate does not increase the heat produced by the minigun, which means you unfortunately cannot take advantage of either Hot Bullets or Aggressive Venting faster. This upgrade does arguably give you an increase in DPS on Lead Storm , as you are using your bullets for your damage, but at the cost of a valuable accuracy upgrade (and thus some ammo efficiency, as some of your bullets will miss). Lead Storm already has a massive amount of DPS ; it's kind of redundant to stack more on. Increased accuracy is very valuable on any fully automatic weapon. Verdict Take option 3 T1C Improved Platform Stability . Tier 2 \u00b6 A somewhat boring tier, Oversized Drum adds 600 ammo to our pool, bumping us up to 3000, while High Velocity Rounds increases our damage per bullet by 2, for a total of 12. This is a personal choice, but it's important to note that Hot Bullets is affected by the damage upgrade; a fraction of your total damage is ADDED as heat damage (not converted), and thus you will heat enemies faster if you take the damage mod. Hot Bullets Hot Bullets is affected by the damage upgrade. More damage means more heat damage is added, allowing you to heat up enemies faster (very helpful if you use Volatile Bullets ). Verdict Take either option, T2A Oversized Drum or T2B High Velocity Rounds . Tier 3 \u00b6 Now we're getting to the good stuff. Hardened Rounds gives us 200% extra armor break, for a total of 300%. Improved Stun gives us 20% extra Stun chance, for a total of 40%. Blowthrough Rounds gives us one blowthrough penetration per bullet. Since you're using your bullets themselves to deal the majority of your damage, armor break can be quite helpful. It allows you to shred Brundles and Shellbacks quite quickly, but it also gives you more damage output on Grunts and their variants, as oftentimes you will not be hitting their weakpoints. Stun is a multiplicative upgrade, which means that it has a minimized effect when combined with the stun decrease in the Lead Storm overclock. Instead of a 40% stun chance with something like Burning Hell , Lead Storm gets a paltry 10% stun chance. This combined with a shorter stun duration means stun does not have very much value on Lead Storm . In fact, it can even be a hindrance, as a micro-stun will upset some enemies' pathing patterns, such as Wardens, which can make them wiggle around and cause you to miss quite a few bullets. Blowthrough is exceptional on Lead Storm , as an extra penetration allows you to theoretically double your DPS against swarms. It's also funny to be shooting a Dreadnaught and see one of your teammates' health bars go from full to 0 in 3 seconds because they stood on the wrong side of it. Verdict Take option 1 T3A Hardened Rounds or option 3 T3C Blowthrough Rounds . Experiment with both to see which performs best for you. Tier 4 \u00b6 Another interesting pick. Variable Chamber Pressure gives us a 15% damage boost when the gun is fully stabilized (in other words, when you have reached max fire rate). Lighter Barrel Assembly decreases the spinup time of the minigun from 0.7 to 0.3 seconds, and its opposite, Magnetic Bearings , increases the time the minigun stays spun up by 1 second. Contrary to what I previously said in this post, stacking a 15% increase in DPS on top of Lead Storm's already insane DPS can be very powerful. Unlike the RoF upgrade, this upgrade doesn't force you to miss out on an accuracy upgrade, and doesn't shred your ammo pool any faster than if you had picked otherwise. With bunny hopping, you can hold a full spin quite easily and get quite a bit of use out of this upgrade. Faster spinup can be useful if you find yourself overwhelmed often. The damage upgrade definitely isn't mandatory, and if you're using Lead Storm more as a quick burst option (paired with something like the coilgun's Hellfire), this can be a nice mod to have. Honestly, I really don't know why Magnetic Bearings exists. You can manually tap-fire a couple shots to keep the weapon spun up, and the other two options on this tier blow it out of the water. Verdict Take option 1 T4A Variable Chamber Pressure or option 2 T4B Lighter Barrel Assembly . Tier 5 \u00b6 The most drastic playstyle changes found on the minigun are in this tier. Aggressive Venting makes the gun explode when you overheat, producing large amounts of heat damage and Fear in a decent radius around you, while also reducing the recovery time from an overheat in half, to 5 seconds from 10. Cold as the Grave cools the minigun slightly whenever it kills an enemy. Hot Bullets adds 50% of your total damage to the weapon as heat damage. Aggressive Venting is less powerful with Lead Storm than it is with Burning Hell . While it still has quite a lot of value in solo, it's much more difficult to proc, and you will expend much more time and ammo trying to make use of it. In team games, a vent in a dangerous spot can save you, but you can also typically just shield and it won't make nearly as much of a dent in your ammo reserves. Cold as the Grave is honestly an even worse choice on Lead Storm than it is on Burning Hell . You benefit very little from your gun being cooled, as overheating already takes a very long time and you can usually get enough breathing room to take a break from sustained fire long enough to cool down. Hot Bullets is another nice damage boost that can help tear apart most targets, as well as being a nice ignition source, even if it's much slower than Burning Hell . Contrary to Burning Hell , Lead Storm benefits much more from igniting many targets at once before switching to Volatile Bullets to finish them off. If you're skilled enough, you can usually keep the minigun in the red even after taking 2 or 3 VB shots. Verdict Take option 1 T5A Aggressive Venting if you find you really need more survivability. Otherwise, take option 3 T5C Hot Bullets . Secondary and Grenades \u00b6 While Volatile Bullets Bulldog is still a good pick, especially in teams where others can ignite, it's much less necessary than when using Burning Hell . If you're expecting your team to be lacking in crowd clear, you can instead opt to take Hellfire on the coilgun, which has pretty insane waveclear. Cluster grenades and incendiary grenades are both competitive choices. Sticky grenades, IMO , don't do enough swarm clear on their own for them to be worth it, even with their Fear potential. Clusters can be used to wipe large groups of trash or as an on-demand large area stun button for Mactera. Incendiaries have similar swarm clear to clusters, but they trade the stun potential for an instant ignition source, which can be useful with Volatile Bullets . Playstyle and Tips \u00b6 Lead Storm requires you to be much more aware of your positioning; the terrain, where enemies are coming from, what point you're at in the mission, these are all factors that can determine whether or not you survive or die in a swarm. Zipline camping is a legitimate tactic, as you are much less mobile than when using other Gunner primary builds. Keep your distance. Set up sightlines and use blowthrough if you have it to hold a line of enemies at bay. Assuming you're not using the faster spin-up mod, you can \"pre-spin\" the minigun when you hear bugs spawn so that it will be fully spun up when they come into view. This is most effective when done while airborne. Don't feel bad popping a shield before hunkering down and shredding a group of targets, whether they be Mactera, Spitters, or even Grunts that you don't think you can handle safely. A high health Gunner that's down a shield is much more valuable than a low health or dead Gunner, as being dead means you can't shield anyway. You will need to hug a Sticky Fuel driller much more than if you had Burning Hell , as while you have arguably much more powerful swarm clear than Burning Hell , it can only be applied effectively in one direction at once. The combo of Lead Storm and Volatile Bullets is much more situational than with Burning Hell ; you will have to decide for yourself in many situations if focusing an enemy down with Lead Storm will be faster than trying to ignite it and then use Volatile Bullets . Use your grenades often. They can be lifesavers. This goes for any Gunner playstyle, but try to use shields proactively, rather than reactively. A team of 4 living dwarves can take advantage of a shield much more effectively than 3 dwarves trying to revive someone who died because there wasn't a shield down.

The damage upgrade definitely isn't mandatory, and if you're using Lead Storm more as a quick burst option (paired with something like the coilgun's Hellfire), this can be a nice mod to have. Honestly, I really don't know why Magnetic Bearings exists. You can manually tap-fire a couple shots to keep the weapon spun up, and the other two options on this tier blow it out of the water. Verdict Take option 1 T4A Variable Chamber Pressure or option 2 T4B Lighter Barrel Assembly .","title":"Tier 4"},{"location":"builds/lsls/#tier-5","text":"The most drastic playstyle changes found on the minigun are in this tier. Aggressive Venting makes the gun explode when you overheat, producing large amounts of heat damage and Fear in a decent radius around you, while also reducing the recovery time from an overheat in half, to 5 seconds from 10. Cold as the Grave cools the minigun slightly whenever it kills an enemy. Hot Bullets adds 50% of your total damage to the weapon as heat damage. Aggressive Venting is less powerful with Lead Storm than it is with Burning Hell . While it still has quite a lot of value in solo, it's much more difficult to proc, and you will expend much more time and ammo trying to make use of it. In team games, a vent in a dangerous spot can save you, but you can also typically just shield and it won't make nearly as much of a dent in your ammo reserves. Cold as the Grave is honestly an even worse choice on Lead Storm than it is on Burning Hell . You benefit very little from your gun being cooled, as overheating already takes a very long time and you can usually get enough breathing room to take a break from sustained fire long enough to cool down. Hot Bullets is another nice damage boost that can help tear apart most targets, as well as being a nice ignition source, even if it's much slower than Burning Hell . Contrary to Burning Hell , Lead Storm benefits much more from igniting many targets at once before switching to Volatile Bullets to finish them off. If you're skilled enough, you can usually keep the minigun in the red even after taking 2 or 3 VB shots. Verdict Take option 1 T5A Aggressive Venting if you find you really need more survivability. Otherwise, take option 3 T5C Hot Bullets .","title":"Tier 5"},{"location":"builds/lsls/#secondary-and-grenades","text":"While Volatile Bullets Bulldog is still a good pick, especially in teams where others can ignite, it's much less necessary than when using Burning Hell . If you're expecting your team to be lacking in crowd clear, you can instead opt to take Hellfire on the coilgun, which has pretty insane waveclear. Cluster grenades and incendiary grenades are both competitive choices. Sticky grenades, IMO , don't do enough swarm clear on their own for them to be worth it, even with their Fear potential. Clusters can be used to wipe large groups of trash or as an on-demand large area stun button for Mactera. Incendiaries have similar swarm clear to clusters, but they trade the stun potential for an instant ignition source, which can be useful with Volatile Bullets .","title":"Secondary and Grenades"},{"location":"builds/lsls/#playstyle-and-tips","text":"Lead Storm requires you to be much more aware of your positioning; the terrain, where enemies are coming from, what point you're at in the mission, these are all factors that can determine whether or not you survive or die in a swarm. Zipline camping is a legitimate tactic, as you are much less mobile than when using other Gunner primary builds. Keep your distance. Set up sightlines and use blowthrough if you have it to hold a line of enemies at bay. Assuming you're not using the faster spin-up mod, you can \"pre-spin\" the minigun when you hear bugs spawn so that it will be fully spun up when they come into view. This is most effective when done while airborne. Don't feel bad popping a shield before hunkering down and shredding a group of targets, whether they be Mactera, Spitters, or even Grunts that you don't think you can handle safely. A high health Gunner that's down a shield is much more valuable than a low health or dead Gunner, as being dead means you can't shield anyway. You will need to hug a Sticky Fuel driller much more than if you had Burning Hell , as while you have arguably much more powerful swarm clear than Burning Hell , it can only be applied effectively in one direction at once. The combo of Lead Storm and Volatile Bullets is much more situational than with Burning Hell ; you will have to decide for yourself in many situations if focusing an enemy down with Lead Storm will be faster than trying to ignite it and then use Volatile Bullets . Use your grenades often. They can be lifesavers. This goes for any Gunner playstyle, but try to use shields proactively, rather than reactively. A team of 4 living dwarves can take advantage of a shield much more effectively than 3 dwarves trying to revive someone who died because there wasn't a shield down. Shield before you're overrun, rather than after.","title":"Playstyle and Tips"},{"location":"builds/m1000/","tags":["m1000","scout","build","active-stability-system","minimal-clips","hoverclock","electrifying-focus-shots","hipster","hazard-6x2"],"text":"Build Breakdown: Multi-Choice M1000 Classic (Scout's Primary, Modded Hazard 6x2) \u00b6 Post Info Author u/Virryn__ Post Date 2022-07-12 Original Post Link BUILD BREAKDOWN: Multi-Choice (Scout's M1000 Classic) [MODDED: Haz6x2] This breakdown post will be a bit different from the others I've written so far. The M1000 is debatably the most well balanced weapon in DRG, in that it has the most competitive overclock options available to it out of any weapon in the game on modded difficulties. As such, this post will be considering multiple overclock choices: Active Stability System , Minimal Clips , Hoverclock , and Electrifying Focus Shots . In this post, I'll be referring to this setup as MCMC ( M ulti- C hoice M 1000 C lassic). For useful M1000 (both Hipster and normal) breakpoints, see M1000 Classic Breakpoints . A Breakdown of Multi-Choice M1000 \u00b6 Scout is, for the most part, the king of precision, and the closest thing that Deep Rock has to a support class. While the other classes rely largely on their weapons and usually end up using their equipment sparingly or as a last resort, Scout is unique in that his mobility is a necessary part of his core combat loop. It is apt, then, that we look at one of the weapons that complements his movement the most: the M1000 Classic. All numbers in this post are taken from karl.gg . TL;DR 231XX is high skill, high reward. Tier 4 has some interesting distinctions that I'll go into more detail on below. Stun and fear on Tier 5 are both very good picks. Blowthrough paired with IFGs and fear can be incredible crowd control. Why MCMC ? \u00b6 Hipster is a powerful option on Hazard 5. The large ammo pool combined with decent grunt clear capabilities and fast-acting DPS on Praets and Oppressors give the average player a lot of leeway in terms of choosing what to spend their ammo on. Where Hipster struggles, however, is against the kind of high importance targets that are at the top of the priority list in modded games; Menaces, Mactera, Shellbacks (if you're not taking Armor Break), Wardens, etc. Hipster loses a lot of its DPS at mid- to long-range because of its hipfire spam requirement. MCMC , on the other hand, leans much further into focus shots, while still retaining the utility of a quick emergency hipfire. This is the most versatile setup with the M1000, largely because of the breakpoints it hits. Some important ones being: Hipfire headshot and focus shot bodyshot grunts; Focus shot headshot slashers (and guards if you have WP damage); Focus shot bodyshot acid spitters; and Focus shot weakpoint shot Mactera Spawn and Trijaws, to name a few. MCMC consists of 4 options: Active Stability System , Minimal Clips , Hoverclock , and Electrifying Focus Shots . Active Stability System is my personal favorite. It trades a slight bit of sustain (a slower reload speed) for slightly faster burst (faster focus speed) which allows you to get in and out of situations that much faster. Minimal Clips gives you a fair nudge in the direction of sustain, with more ammo in the mag and a faster reload speed, allowing you to possibly kill another dangerous target before a reload, while also letting you get back into the action faster with a new mag. Hoverclock , after you learn it, gives Scout even more mobility options, though compared to Special Powder or Dash, Hoverclock is largely a defensive tactic. Electrifying Focus Shots trades a small bit of focus damage for a DoT electric tick. While this DoT (especially the slow portion) can be powerful against things such as Praets or Goo Bombers, having to trade focus shot damage for it means that you will end up having to wait for the DoT to tick for certain enemies to die. The most egregious example of this is Acid Spitters; while they will still die as they would to another MCMC OC , they will be alive for a few extra seconds, which could allow them to get a shot off at a teammate. Personally, I see no reason to take this overclock over another choice, though I believe it does still hit all the important breakpoints. Tier 1 \u00b6 A fairly boring tier, we have Expanded Ammo Bags and Increased Caliber Rounds , which give +40 ammo and +10 damage respectively. A newer player may benefit more from having a larger ammo pool, but if you're playing modded you're likely not a new player. Verdict Take option 2 T1B Increased Caliber Rounds . Tier 2 \u00b6 This tier has 3 options, but sadly it's the most brainless tier on the gun. Fast-Charging Coils gives us +25% more focus speed, Better Weight Balance reduces per-shot spread by 30%, max crosshair bloom by 20%, and recoil by 50%, and Hardened Rounds gives us 220% armor break potential. Faster focus speed is nice to have, but is overshadowed by armor breaking by a wide margin. As long as you're not hipfire spamming, the M1000's spread and recoil are easily manageable. Armor break is incredibly helpful against not only Shellbacks and Brundles, but also Grunts, as their bodies are indeed armored. Verdict Take option 3 T2C Hardened Rounds . Tier 3 \u00b6 A more interesting but ultimately pretty obvious tier: Killer Focus , a 25% focus shot damage increase, versus Extended Clip , which gives us +6 bullets in the mag. Focus shots are the bread and butter of this setup. More focus damage helps out quite a bit against plenty of enemies; Spitballers, Goo Bombers, Menaces, Praets, the list goes on. A larger magazine lets you kill more per mag, but you have a grappling hook. You can easily reposition to get some breathing room and reload, without having to give up a sizable damage increase. Verdict Take option 1 T3A Killer Focus . Tier 4 \u00b6 Here we have a hotly debated choice. Super Blowthrough Rounds gives the gun +3 penetrations on both focus and hipfire shots, while Hollow Point Bullets grants us +20% weakpoint damage. Blowthrough, combined with T5 fear and an IFG , can be used to repel most enemies back through a choke over and over ad infinitum. It can also have ammo efficiency and TTK benefits, as often on modded, two Spitters or Mactera end up lining themselves up for blowthrough shots. You can also usually group up Praetorians and get some heavy damage on them, and it's fun to blow right through a Mactera charging up at you and kill a teammate chilling across the map. Weakpoint damage gives you a notable breakpoint in that you can kill a Hazard 6 Menace scaled up to 4 players with 4 focus weakpoint shots, as opposed to blowthrough which needs an additional hipfire shot. This is most relevant for Active Stability System and Hoverclock. WP damage also gives you a nice bit more stopping power against Spitballers, Oppressors, Goo Bombers, Dreadnaughts, Wardens, etc. Verdict Personal choice . I prefer option 2 T4B Hollow Point Bullets . Tier 5 \u00b6 The most playstyle- and build-defining tier on this weapon. Hitting Where It Hurts gives your focus shots a 100% chance to Stun whatever it hits. Precision Terror gives your focused weakpoint kills a 100% chance to inflict Fear on enemies that can be feared, within 4 meters. Killing Machine reduces your reload time by 0.75 seconds if you reload 1 second after a kill. Stun is an incredibly powerful status effect, and can be used both offensively and defensively. It helps hit follow up weakpoint shots on Wardens, lets you stop a Menace from barraging you or your team, forces a Praetorian to stop spitting, and causes Goo Bombers to pause momentarily, even if they're spraying goo on the ground. Fear has two main uses: forcing ground back through a choke (or just generally away from you), and forcing Mactera to turn away from you and your team for a bit of breathing room. If you're not running cryo grenades and find yourself consistently mown down by Mactera, consider taking Fear. A faster reload sounds nice, but on a class with multiple fast repositioning options and a weapon that already reloads pretty fast, a slightly quicker reload quickly becomes redundant. That, combined with the fact that the same effect can be achieved with animation cancelling, means Killing Machine really isn't worth taking. Verdict Take options 1 T5A Hitting Where It Hurts or 2 T5B Precision Terror . Secondary and Grenades \u00b6 White Phosphorous Boomstick gives you a lot of up-close burst damage, while also letting you utilize fire spread to thin out a swarm easily and efficiently, and giving you a lot of ignite potential for a Volatile Bullets Gunner on your team. You can also take Cryo Bolt or Fire Bolt Boltshark, which let you deal with stationary enemies and grunts well respectively, though sadly Fire Bolts are much too slow to get much ignite value out of for the Gunner. Embedded Detonators Zhukovs is an option, but they're really only powerful against Praetorians and Oppressors, which are almost never the main focus of a combat engagement; you will have enough damage against them with the M1000 itself. Cryo grenades and IFGs are both very competitive picks. The choice largely comes down to how your team deals with Mactera. If the Driller is skilled with Thin Containment Field and the Engineer is running Inferno, you're probably fine taking IFGs, and if you really want to you can take Fear on tier 5 to make up for them. If your team struggles with or has limited options against Mactera, cryos are quite powerful as Mactera clouds show up often on modded difficulties, and have the added benefit of taking out Breeders, as well as the ability to flash-freeze a teammate's body for an easy revive. However, you lose out on the team-wide benefits of IFGs, which can be used to practically lock down a Bulk before it reaches an objective (Doretta, a nicely-prepared Salvage objective, etc.), or can be utilized to block off a team's flank from encroaching enemies that the other classes haven't yet noticed. Playstyle and Tips \u00b6 An MCMC user needs to be focused on keeping their team alive. You are Overwatch; you are the early warning system for your team, looking in while picking off dangers from the outskirts of the battle before zipping in and letting loose a few Boomstick shells at a pack of slashers and a clean hipfire headshot on a grunt that was about to take a piece out of somebody. Play with and around your team; mirror their movements, stick with them, try to support them if they take a wrong turn and become vulnerable. Grapple often. You have no reason to be near the swarm; don't feel bad about fleeing to draw a flock of Mactera away from the others so you can pick them off more safely yourself. Without the proper setup, you have almost no swarm clearing potential. In a team scenario, you should never shoot at Grunts first if there are other enemies on the board. Only take them out if they're an immediate danger to you or someone you're watching. Whether you have Stun or Fear, use them both as often as necessary. Two bullets spent on a Praet's armor plate aren't two bullets wasted if they blocked that Praet from inflicting heavy damage to an unsuspecting teammate; likewise, focusing a Mactera Spawn over a Trijaw to proc Fear may save someone's life, even if you thought the Trijaw was the higher priority target. Use IFGs often. You have 6 of them, and you get 3 back per resupply. Hand them out like candy. The Engineer's stuck in a pit with bugs running down on him? Chuck two at him, now he has much more legroom and time to kite them around. A line of grunts have strolled through an unnoticed hole in the repellant? Fastball an IFG at them, and they're out of commission for anywhere from 5 to 15 seconds. Grapple in the middle of a reload if necessary. Bullets in your gun are nice, but they're useless if you can't spend them because three Trijaws unloaded on you while you were slashed in the middle of a reload. Reposition, then strike, not vice versa. Flare often. Press 4 and Mouse1. While this is largely a focus shot build, hipfires are still fair game. Headshot Grunts, bodyshot Web Spitters, and waste 3 bullets missing a Swarmer that you could have just pickaxed, all without remorse. Just make sure you make up the misses with hard hits.","title":"Multi-Choice M1000 Classic"},{"location":"builds/m1000/#build-breakdown-multi-choice-m1000-classic-scouts-primary-modded-hazard-6x2","text":"Post Info Author u/Virryn__ Post Date 2022-07-12 Original Post Link BUILD BREAKDOWN: Multi-Choice (Scout's M1000 Classic) [MODDED: Haz6x2] This breakdown post will be a bit different from the others I've written so far.

I'm new to Reddit so forgive any weird formatting issues. In the context of this post, \"modded difficulties\" mostly means difficulties with enemy count multipliers, such as 5x2, 6x2, 7x1.5, etc. All numbers in this post were taken directly from the Equipment Terminal in-game. A Breakdown of Sticky Fuel \u00b6 Driller as a class is heavily focused on crowd control and trash clear. While he has some options for large burst damage (Ice Spear, Volatile Impact Mixture, Sludge Blast), he shines best when built for quick and easy deletion of large squishy crowds. Nothing in Driller's kit (and quite frankly, almost nothing in the entire game, bar maybe Neurotoxin Payload) does this more safely and efficiently than Sticky Fuel. Tip TL;DR: 23232 Sticky Fuel is optimal. Combine with TCF EPC and axes. Why Sticky Fuel? \u00b6 Fuel Stream Diffuser and Compact Feed Valves are both competitive builds for the sticky flames playstyle on Hazard 5. However, the increased enemy speed on Haz6 and Haz7 means that the extra sticky flame damage that Sticky Fuel provides becomes necessary to kill Grunts and their counterparts in as few lines of sticky as possible, before they walk through the sticky and another line becomes necessary. While this doesn't really impact your overall ammo usage, it becomes very apparent during swarm pressure; if you need to apply another line of sticky that's closer to you, that means bugs are gaining ground ever so slightly on you, and Sticky Fuel helps to alleviate this pressure. It's important to note that Grunt, Guard, and Slasher health does not increase in modded difficulties; in fact, Grunts in a 4-player Haz7 lobby have the exact same health as Grunts in a Haz4 solo mission. The extra sticky flame damage also does help to kill tankier enemies more quickly, such as Spitballers, Praetorians, Menaces, etc. The extended sticky flame duration from Sticky Fuel also gives you a lot more attention economy . In a horde shooter such as Deep Rock, your attention is divided between aspects of the game such as trash enemies, special enemies, large enemies, and even at times the objective. The difference between an 8-second line of sticky with Fuel Stream Diffuser versus an 11- or 14-second line with Sticky Fuel may not seem large, but in the heat of the moment, 3 seconds is a long time; gaining 3 seconds of attention to use on moving to the opposite side of a room to place down another line of sticky can be the difference between a safe defensive position and being overrun. Tier 1 \u00b6 On the first tier of the CRSPR we have two choices: High Capacity Tanks , an additional 25 ammo in the magazine, or High Pressure Ejector , an additional 5 meters of applicable range. While the obvious choice seems to be increased magazine size to counter the 25 mag reduction that comes with Sticky Fuel, the range increase is actually the optimal choice, for two reasons. Sticky Fuel is powerful enough that there are almost no situations where you need to quickly expend 50 ammo to keep yourself safe. Sticky Fuel is not worth using as an offensive burst tool; if you have time to place sticky flames safely, you should also have time to reload safely, otherwise, you should be drilling out of that situation or running towards a teammate or Gunner shield. A magazine of 25 is more than enough to place a line or two of sticky on both sides of a defense point. Range allows you to place sticky flames much further away from yourself (obviously). On modded difficulties, a sticky Driller is required to continually apply sticky to both sides of a defense point (salvage, black boxes, etc.). With the range upgrade, you need to move a lot less to cover the necessary points with sticky, and thus you end up with more time to split your attention elsewhere. (Range also helps in general usage, but its effect is more obvious with a static reference point.) Verdict Take option 2, T1B High Pressure Ejector . Tier 2 \u00b6 Tier 2 gives us three options. Unfiltered Fuel gives us 4 extra damage on the direct flame only . Triple Filtered Fuel adds 10 heat applied per damage tick, for a total of 20, and Sticky Flame Duration adds 3 more seconds of sticky. Extra direct damage on a sticky-focused build is useless. Extra heat, while slightly useful for igniting targets for a Volatile Bullets Gunner, is still overshadowed by longer sticky flames. However, Triple Filtered Fuel is a good choice when facing Rival enemies. 3 seconds of sticky, combined with Sticky Fuel itself, gives us 11 seconds of sticky per application so far. This is a fairly obvious choice for a sticky-based playstyle. Verdict Rival Presence missions, Industrial Sabotage Everything else Take option 2, T2B Triple Filtered Fuel , for Rival Presence missions or Industrial sabotage. Take option 3, T2C Sticky Flame Duration for anything else, or Rival missions where your teammates are also building for fire and can handle bots easily. Tier 3 \u00b6 Another three-option row, we're given the choice between: Oversized Valves : a 30% increase in flow rate; Sticky Flame Slowdown , which slows enemies that travel through sticky flames; and More Fuel , an extra 75 max ammo. Here, we again have an opportunity to counter one of Sticky Fuel's downsides, this time being the 75 ammo loss. However, slowing enemies that travel through your flames is essential to this build, and the next tier lets us make up for that ammo penalty anyways. Verdict Take option 2, T3B Sticky Flame Slowdown . Tier 4 \u00b6 Again a triple row, but this one is more interesting than the previous. It Burns! gives us 20% Fear factor on direct damage ticks, Sticky Flame Duration gives us another 3 seconds of sticky, and More Fuel gives us 75 more ammo. I won't get into Fear calculations in this post, but I'm not sure why you would want to take It Burns! even in a direct damage build, let alone a sticky build. The chance seems pretty tiny, it forces the enemy to run away from your damage (as opposed to something like the Thunderhead's Fear, where the Thunderhead is a long range hitscan weapon), and most direct damage CRSPR builds are focused on taking advantage of Heat Radiance , which relies on enemies being close to you. Don't use this mod in a sticky build. 3 more seconds of sticky is a nice bonus, but with Sticky Fuel and Sticky Flame Duration on Tier 2, we're already at 11 seconds of sticky duration. That's more than enough to bounce between two lines of sticky if needed, but some players do prefer to take this mod over the ammo increase. A 75 ammo increase is incredibly valuable. This bumps your max ammo up to 300 (+25 mag), which can take you FAR in a mission. If you play this build well, on Haz5 you'll likely have more than half your sticky left when your pub teammates are chewing through their second resupply. Verdict Take option 2 T4B Sticky Flame Duration or 3 T4C More Fuel ; 3 has more overall sticky duration, while 2 can give you more immediate attention economy. 2 is also a good option if you want to force yourself to learn to be more efficient in your sticky play. Tier 5 \u00b6 This will likely be the most controversial tier. Heat Radiance heats enemies in an area around you while you are firing the CRSPR, while Targets Explode gives you a 50% chance when killing an enemy with direct fire for the target to explode. This may come as a surprise, but the optimal choice is actually Targets Explode. Why? Heat Radiance , with a 25 magazine size and a sticky-based playstyle, does almost nothing for you. If you're playing Heat Radiance offensively, you should build for it with something like Compact Feed Valves. If you're playing it defensively, 25 ammo in your mag isn't going to save you. If you're playing Sticky Fuel and are in range of the bugs, you should be drilling away rather than trying to kill things with Heat Radiance. Targets Explode does not proc on sticky flame kills. HOWEVER, this is not the purpose of Targets Explode. Targets Explode is used almost EXCLUSIVELY on clouds of Naedocytes and the river of Swarmers that erupts when a Brood Nexus is popped. These enemies are admittedly not substantial threats on Haz 5. However, on modded difficulties with increased enemy multipliers, these can get out of hand very quickly. A breeder or two left alive in a salvage room for long enough can produce hundreds of jellies, so it helps to have a method to deal with them as Driller. Similarly, Shocker clouds spawning on top of players can be a death sentence if not dealt with immediately, and Targets Explode can wipe out quite a few of them if it manages to proc. Sadly Targets Explode is not very effective against Shredders, as they have a slightly larger health pool. Verdict Take option 2, T5B Targets Explode . Secondary and Grenades \u00b6 While the Wave Cooker has some interesting temperature shock synergy with sticky flames, it unfortunately doesn't stand up to Thin Containment Field in terms of versatility. Similarly, the precision the Subata gives doesn't make up for its pitiful damage output. The best secondary choice for Driller is the EPC built for TCF ; this allows you to easily handle clouds of Mactera, chunk some damage off of Praetorians and similarly tanky enemies, quickly mine objectives and minerals, and delete large amounts of terrain quickly when required. Persistent Plasma is also quite powerful, and provides an impressive amount of wave clear when applied right. Neurotoxin and HE grenades are mostly redundant on a class such as Driller. He already has plenty of primary and secondary setups for crowd clearing; therefore, a grenade that gives him some chunky single target damage is invaluable. Axes are the way to go. Playstyle and Tips \u00b6 A Sticky Fuel Driller becomes the cornerstone of their team. You are the primary protection against Grunts and Swarmers, and you provide a quick and constant ignition source for a Volatile Bullets Gunner, who acts as your heavy hitter against larger targets. For the most part, you become the team leader; you make the decisions, and the rest of the team either follows or more than likely gets overwhelmed. Taking Sticky Fuel allows the rest of the team to spec more heavily into special- and tank-clearing roles. Ideal sticky placement is a few distinct lines of sticky flames on a bug path. If you place sticky multiple times on a single line, you're only getting one line worth of sticky damage; they do not stack. You only need two or three lines to deal with most Grunt packs. Putting down a sticky circle around a resupply or downed teammate can allow you to take ammo or revive without being interrupted and damaged by Grunts; however, if a Praetorian or Oppressor is on a teammate, sticky flames are likely not going to cut it. Small puffs of sticky under tanky targets like Praetorians helps to keep them on fire and taking damage. While minimal, you'll end up with less of them walking around with a sliver of health. The slowdown also helps to keep them in place for precision classes to hit them more easily, and prevents them from sneaking up on you and spitting at you quite as easily. While you should try to stay with your team and keep them alive, if a situation becomes unwinnable, don't hesitate to drill away and lay a circle of sticky on the sides of your tunnel. Sticky drilling is one of the safest setups in the game when played right, and you are a lot more valuable alive alone than dead with your teammates. Don't use a direct stream of flame against anything except targets you are trying to kill with Targets Explode. Always make an attempt to lay sticky beneath what you're shooting at instead, then swap to your secondary or use your axes to do the majority of the damage. For Mactera, the damage they take even with their innate weakness to Fire doesn't kill them very quickly, and you're better off TCF -ing or axing them. Even without Barbed Drills, your drills have a high chance to both Fear and Stun enemies. When you're about to hit by a Slasher or a Mactera, try to get in the habit of quickly switching to your drills and going for a stun to get them to stop attacking. This works on Praetorians as well. This loadout shines most when in voice comms with teammates, where you can dictate how you're going to move through the mission, which positions you're going to hold in, etc. Teammates that run away from a sticky Driller will usually not end up surviving for long on modded difficulties. Why Not Sludge? \u00b6 Besides some enemies in the game having a weakness to Fire and a resistance to Corrosive (because GSG hates the Sludge Pump I guess), sludge doesn't have the ease of placement that sticky flames does. You can place a sticky line immediately if you need to; if you want to put down sludge, you either have to settle for the tiny, dinky little single puddles that you can't place very fast, or you need to spend valuable time charging a shot that won't even stick to ceilings or walls very well. Ignited sludge can produce similar damage and slow to sticky, but requires more setup time and an ignite source, both of which are less than ideal. The unfortunate reality is that sludge is nowhere near as powerful as sticky is on modded difficulties.","title":"Sticky Fuel"},{"location":"builds/sticky-fuel/#build-breakdown-sticky-fuel-drillers-crspr-modded-hazard-6x2","text":"Post Info Author u/Virryn__ Post Date 2022-05-29 Intended Difficulty Modded, e.g. 5x2, 6x2, 7x1.5 Original Post Link BUILD BREAKDOWN: Sticky Fuel (Driller's CRSPR) [MODDED: Haz6x2] Since no one else has posted anything here yet, I figured I'd break the ice with one of the most popular and powerful builds in modded difficulties.

However, the increased enemy speed on Haz6 and Haz7 means that the extra sticky flame damage that Sticky Fuel provides becomes necessary to kill Grunts and their counterparts in as few lines of sticky as possible, before they walk through the sticky and another line becomes necessary. While this doesn't really impact your overall ammo usage, it becomes very apparent during swarm pressure; if you need to apply another line of sticky that's closer to you, that means bugs are gaining ground ever so slightly on you, and Sticky Fuel helps to alleviate this pressure. It's important to note that Grunt, Guard, and Slasher health does not increase in modded difficulties; in fact, Grunts in a 4-player Haz7 lobby have the exact same health as Grunts in a Haz4 solo mission. The extra sticky flame damage also does help to kill tankier enemies more quickly, such as Spitballers, Praetorians, Menaces, etc. The extended sticky flame duration from Sticky Fuel also gives you a lot more attention economy .

With Breach Cutter, his secondary is even anti-tank. This leaves his primary in an interesting place where it can handle multiple roles in a flexible fashion, be it sniping spitters, contributing secondary AOE , helping with burst damage on high-HP foes, and, of course, self-defense and skirmishing. Stunner Warthog is a great pick for many of these roles and pairs well with the rest of the tools in the usual Engi\u2019s kit. It\u2019s a hidden powerhouse for both offense and defense. TL;DR Recommended build is 12321 with 11221 as another option. Why Stunner? \u00b6 Stunner seems like an odd pick to the uninitiated. At a first glance, it seems like both Magnetic Pellet Alignment ( MPA ) and Cycle Overload ( CO ) will be better for damage and/or accuracy. MPA is indisputably a powerhouse OC, providing a huge accuracy increase that synergizes with its +30% weakpoint bonus. This makes it great for distant foes and gives it an edge versus tanks. The issue is the fire rate penalty, which cuts into its DPS and self-defense. Miner Adjustments can compensate but that means sacrificing Turret Whip. Turret Whip is a very powerful mod, dealing 160 explosive damage with fear, stun, and armor break all-in-one for the low cost of 1 Warthog ammo and 5 turret ammo. It\u2019s a huge reason to take Warthog in 6x2, and MPA forces you to either sacrifice Whip to make up for the fire rate or have a sluggish Warthog with Whip that is less capable of skirmishing and killing high-HP foes quickly. CO gives a sizable damage and fire rate boost, great for high DPS versus high-HP foes. However, the penalty to accuracy and the recoil from a high fire rate really limit its ability to damage foes at range. You\u2019re either taking choke and sacrificing ammo and pellets or taking Recoil Dampener and limiting the damage available in your clip. Miner Adjustments unlocks CO \u2019s highest DPS potential but again requires sacrificing the huge boon that is Turret Whip. CO \u2019s power is limited by the build constraints created by its penalties and the value of Turret Whip. Stunner makes none of these sacrifices. It\u2019s able to take Whip without greatly impacting its fire rate/ DPS , it doesn\u2019t need to compensate for any penalties, and it still has an easily accessible 30% damage boost. In addition to all that, its ability to stun on any body part not only synergizes with its damage-vs-stunned but provides the Engi using it with greatly improve crowd control ( CC ) for both general control and self-defense/skirmishing. Damage, safety, and utility galore. Excels in both solo and in teams. Tier 1 \u00b6 Taking Supercharged Feed Mechanism is great for Warthog general DPS . Nothing more to say really. If you\u2019re going to take a magazine mod, take it on Tier 3 instead of cutting into your fire rate for Overstuffed Magazine here. Verdict Take T1A Supercharged Feed Mechanism . Tier 2 \u00b6 Preferential tier. I personally take Loaded Shells . This adds 16 damage (assuming damage mod is taken Tier 4, otherwise 14) per shot before additional multipliers, which is already very nice, but it has additional synergy with Stunner. Stun chance on the Warthog is on a per pellet basis, so going from 8 pellets at base to 10 with Loaded Shells increases the chance for a stun from a shot by ~10% (56.95% to 65.13%) assuming all pellets hit. Another popular pick is Expanded Ammo Bags . +42 ammo is a huge boon for long pushes where you might be using your Warthog a lot, and it can offset the ammo spent on Turret Whips. Consider this if taking Loaded Shells leaves you too ammo-tight for your taste. Ignore Choke . The other two mods are too valuable to use it just for some accuracy. Warthog base accuracy is sufficient in most cases, and the stuns from Stunner on non-weakpoint hits + the bonus damage alleviate some of Warthog\u2019s accuracy issues anyways. Verdict Take T2A Expanded Ammo Bags or T2B Loaded Shells . Tier 3 \u00b6 Semi-preferential tier. I consider High Capacity Magazine to be the best pick on this tier. Very slightly more ammo and more sustained fire to use to skirmish or DPS tanks. Since you\u2019re taking fire rate over magazine size on Tier 1, it\u2019s great to get here since you\u2019re not sacrificing much of anything by skipping out on the other two mods. Quickfire Ejector isn\u2019t a bad choice, but I think the base reload speed is fine especially since reload cancelling exists. That and magazine size is just way more valuable. Ignore Recoil Dampener . The other two mods are too valuable and base Warthog recoil without Miner Adjustments is easily compensated for manually. Verdict Take T3C High Capacity Magazine . Tier 4 \u00b6 Bigger Pellets every time. 80 damage a shot versus 70 is big, and the armor-breaking of Tungsten Coated Buckshot is not very valuable on the Warthog, especially with the armor-breaking abilities of Breach Cutter*, Turret Whip, and your turrets available (not to mention your team!). Verdict Take T4B Bigger Pellets . Tier 5 \u00b6 Turret Whip is obviously my pick for this tier if you\u2019ve been paying attention. Great secondary AOE , shears armor off shellbacks and praets, chunks grunt and mactera clusters, and stuns or fears anything that lives. Miner Adjustments is great for a \u201c DPS Stunner\u201d since it can capitalize more on stun windows for more damage. This is a valuable build in vanilla, but in 6x2, Turret Whip is so damn good that it\u2019s better to not pick it. Verdict Take T5A Turret Whip . Secondary and Grenades \u00b6 Breach Cutter is Engi\u2019s best secondary in general but also his best primary for Stunner synergy. The stun mod on Breach Cutter is entirely dominant since its only competition is an unnecessary and potentially buggy armor break mod. 3 seconds of easy stun on a praet or a goo bomber sets them up to be easily finished off with Stunner\u2019s bonus damage. PGL\u2019s stun mod is also 3 seconds and I recommend using it if you\u2019re doing PGL with Stunner, but it does far less damage to tanks and the radial damage hurts goo bomber sacks without getting the weakpoint bonus so it is less optimal. For grenades, anything works really, but mines and LUREs are typically better than plasma bursters. Proxy mines cover flanks and walls/ceilings really well and help round out Engi\u2019s highly defensive kit. LUREs work extremely well for keeping the team and Engi safe, and they work very with Turret Whip if you can place them in the turret sightlines. Whip will keep the LURE clean with killing and with fear, letting you maximize its value and its duration. Playstyle and Tips \u00b6 Stunner works well when you\u2019re always keeping its functionality in mind to maximize that utility. Knowing how/when to stun or not to stun is very important to making it feel the best and getting the most offense and defense. When skirmishing, use thoughtful target switching to maximize defense. If you\u2019ve stunned a grunt and another one is closing in, it can be a good idea to swap to the closer one. Warthog stun is 3 seconds, which gives you plenty of time to target-swap to control what\u2019s chasing you. When skirmishing, focus slashers first! This is usually a good idea in general, but doubly so with Stunner. Even if you don\u2019t kill them, it\u2019s very likely to stun them and keep them from hitting you and dragging you into the swarm. Be aware of your stun durations! If you\u2019re going for a Stunner kill, be aware of what is going to give you the most stun value. The choicest stuns are the 3 second stuns . There are 3 second stuns on Warthog and the Breach Cutter and PGL with their stun mods, plus they exist for Minigun with stun mod, Hurricane with stun mod, and M1000 with stun mod. Do NOT rely on the stuns from Turret Whip or your turrets with the stun mod to provide you with bonus damage. They last 1.5 seconds long and aren\u2019t enough to capitalize on it unless they\u2019re a grunt, which will probably just die to the turret/shotgun blast anyways. VS Guards : Try to hit a guard in the body to break their guarding stance for easy weakpoint follow-ups. VS Praetorians : 1 Breach Cutter shot + 1 8-shot Stunner mag into praet weakpoint + power attack = dead praet (Haz 6 with 4-player scaling). If you use Inferno, you can skip the power attack and let the burn do it if you like. VS Goo Bombers : The Goo Bomber Technique: When a goo bomber is within range, hit a goo bomber in the body for the stun, then swap to the weakpoints to capitalize on the bonus damage. It\u2019ll be helpless and not shooting or gooing the whole time, and you can put it down in 8 shots + a power attack or 10-11 shots depending on pellet spread with just the Warthog. (Breakpoints based on Hazard 6 4-player scaling) You can also use a Breach Cutter shot to the body to save Warthog ammo and speed up the kill. VS Wardens : Even if you aren\u2019t going to be shooting it long-term with your shotgun, stunning wardens is a great idea. It locks them down to easily be killed by the rest of the team, and it disengages them from their buffed entourage, who will then lose the buff after enough distance. Up close, Stunner destroys wardens by stopping their wiggle for easy bulb shots. VS Menaces : If a menace is being a huge nuisance and no one can take care of it, use Stunner to repel it easily. Just make sure you don\u2019t assume this and anger your team. Obviously, Turret Whip is good versus clusters of grunts and mactera, but you can also Whip to kill lone Mactera instantly (especially nice for Trijaws), to break guard stances or shear their armor, to damage and delay a praet, etc. At close range, Turret Whip can be used to kill grunt clusters by kiting them into the mouth of your turret. You can also setup turrets in chokes made by the cave or your repellent plats and let the funnel force them to take the Whip at close range.

With Breach Cutter, his secondary is even anti-tank. This leaves his primary in an interesting place where it can handle multiple roles in a flexible fashion, be it sniping spitters, contributing secondary AOE , helping with burst damage on high-HP foes, and, of course, self-defense and skirmishing. Stunner Warthog is a great pick for many of these roles and pairs well with the rest of the tools in the usual Engi\u2019s kit. It\u2019s a hidden powerhouse for both offense and defense.

At a first glance, it seems like both Magnetic Pellet Alignment ( MPA ) and Cycle Overload ( CO ) will be better for damage and/or accuracy. MPA is indisputably a powerhouse OC, providing a huge accuracy increase that synergizes with its +30% weakpoint bonus. This makes it great for distant foes and gives it an edge versus tanks. The issue is the fire rate penalty, which cuts into its DPS and self-defense. Miner Adjustments can compensate but that means sacrificing Turret Whip. Turret Whip is a very powerful mod, dealing 160 explosive damage with fear, stun, and armor break all-in-one for the low cost of 1 Warthog ammo and 5 turret ammo. It\u2019s a huge reason to take Warthog in 6x2, and MPA forces you to either sacrifice Whip to make up for the fire rate or have a sluggish Warthog with Whip that is less capable of skirmishing and killing high-HP foes quickly. CO gives a sizable damage and fire rate boost, great for high DPS versus high-HP foes. However, the penalty to accuracy and the recoil from a high fire rate really limit its ability to damage foes at range. You\u2019re either taking choke and sacrificing ammo and pellets or taking Recoil Dampener and limiting the damage available in your clip. Miner Adjustments unlocks CO \u2019s highest DPS potential but again requires sacrificing the huge boon that is Turret Whip. CO \u2019s power is limited by the build constraints created by its penalties and the value of Turret Whip. Stunner makes none of these sacrifices. It\u2019s able to take Whip without greatly impacting its fire rate/ DPS , it doesn\u2019t need to compensate for any penalties, and it still has an easily accessible 30% damage boost. In addition to all that, its ability to stun on any body part not only synergizes with its damage-vs-stunned but provides the Engi using it with greatly improve crowd control ( CC ) for both general control and self-defense/skirmishing. Damage, safety, and utility galore.

This adds 16 damage (assuming damage mod is taken Tier 4, otherwise 14) per shot before additional multipliers, which is already very nice, but it has additional synergy with Stunner. Stun chance on the Warthog is on a per pellet basis, so going from 8 pellets at base to 10 with Loaded Shells increases the chance for a stun from a shot by ~10% (56.95% to 65.13%) assuming all pellets hit. Another popular pick is Expanded Ammo Bags . +42 ammo is a huge boon for long pushes where you might be using your Warthog a lot, and it can offset the ammo spent on Turret Whips. Consider this if taking Loaded Shells leaves you too ammo-tight for your taste. Ignore Choke . The other two mods are too valuable to use it just for some accuracy. Warthog base accuracy is sufficient in most cases, and the stuns from Stunner on non-weakpoint hits + the bonus damage alleviate some of Warthog\u2019s accuracy issues anyways.

Quickfire Ejector isn\u2019t a bad choice, but I think the base reload speed is fine especially since reload cancelling exists. That and magazine size is just way more valuable.

The stun mod on Breach Cutter is entirely dominant since its only competition is an unnecessary and potentially buggy armor break mod. 3 seconds of easy stun on a praet or a goo bomber sets them up to be easily finished off with Stunner\u2019s bonus damage. PGL\u2019s stun mod is also 3 seconds and I recommend using it if you\u2019re doing PGL with Stunner, but it does far less damage to tanks and the radial damage hurts goo bomber sacks without getting the weakpoint bonus so it is less optimal. For grenades, anything works really, but mines and LUREs are typically better than plasma bursters. Proxy mines cover flanks and walls/ceilings really well and help round out Engi\u2019s highly defensive kit. LUREs work extremely well for keeping the team and Engi safe, and they work very with Turret Whip if you can place them in the turret sightlines.

If you\u2019ve stunned a grunt and another one is closing in, it can be a good idea to swap to the closer one. Warthog stun is 3 seconds, which gives you plenty of time to target-swap to control what\u2019s chasing you. When skirmishing, focus slashers first! This is usually a good idea in general, but doubly so with Stunner.

This includes Praetorians, Oppressors, Wardens, Menaces, Goo Bombers, Spitballers, and Breeders, to name a few. His best option for this is Volatile Bullets, which pairs very nicely with a Sticky Fuel Driller, a minigun or Hurricane built for fire damage (such as Burning Hell ), and other teammates that have quick and easy ignition options, such as the Scout's White Phosphorus mod on the Boomstick. All numbers in this post are taken from karl.gg 's build section. TL;DR 23321/21311 (they're essentially the same build) are the most reliable options. Best used in a team with other flame-based builds, though can also shine when combined with incendiary grenades or Gunner primaries built for heat. Why Volatile Bullets? \u00b6 Elephant Rounds and Lead Spray are the two biggest competitors to Volatile Bullets, so I'll break them down individually. Some players have also suggested that Homebrew Powder is a good alternative, but I personally am not a huge fan of unreliable RNG-based damage. Elephant Rounds is a good choice when you aren't bringing a quick ignition source to the table, and you know your team is speccing likewise. It has good accuracy, high direct damage, and can be used to quickly delete single targets such as lone Mactera or Spitters, or you can magdump it into a Praetorian's back to chunk a reasonable amount of their health quickly. However, it has two major drawbacks that Volatile Bullets doesn't: massive recoil, and lower magazine size (with a noticable reload speed decrease to boot). The recoil makes the Bulldog incredibly difficult to fire multiple times in succession reliably; most likely, you will end up missing one of your shots. This compounds with the fact that you only get three shots, and you spend quite a bit longer reloading after those three shots than you would if you had Volatile Bullets. Lead Spray is often touted as being one of the best single target damage dealers in the game. The problem with this is that it's on paper. In practice, Lead Spray suffers against anything that isn't in spitting distance, simply because mechanically, the BRT is never as accurate as the Bulldog can be. As such, many of your bullets are wasted. Compared to Volatile Bullets or Elephant Rounds, you will likely need to spend quite a bit more time ensuring that you've killed the Mactera or Spitter you were shooting at, as some of your bullets likely missed the target. So why use Volatile Bullets? Because its downside has almost no impact on its performance, and its upside is massive. You get triple QUADRUPLE damage on burning targets, compared to cryo's 3x bonus, and you ALSO get weakpoint damage applied, with a weakpoint damage bonus of 60%. On Hazard 6 with 4 players, Volatile Bullets can 4-weakpoint-shot a Bulk Detonator with an IFG on top of it, and kill it in roughly 6 or 7 weakpoint hits without an IFG. Tier 1 \u00b6 First, we have a choice between Quickfire Ejector , a 0.7 second reload time decrease, and Perfect Weight Balance , a 70% decrease in spread. You should really be running Born Ready on a fire Gunner build, so a reload speed bump is unnecessary. Even if it weren't, the accuracy boost is basically mandatory to be able to hit the broad side of a barn, and the base reload speed of the Bulldog is fast enough. Verdict Take option 2 T1A Perfect Weight Balance . Tier 2 and 4 \u00b6 I'm combining these tiers because they each have identical damage and ammo mods, Increased Caliber Rounds/High Velocity Rounds and Increased Ammo Bags/Increased Ammo Bags , which increase damage by 10 or ammo by 12 respectively. Tier 2 also has Floating Barrel , which reduces your successive shot spread by 80% and your recoil by 25%. Double damage Volatile Bullets is really not worth it. It doesn't hit any new breakpoints on juicy targets except Wardens and Menaces (which will have likely already taken enough damage during ignition to die without double damage), and you lose a lot of damage potential to overkill on enemies such as Praetorians. Even if your aim is good, you will likely end up out of ammo too soon for it to matter. Double ammo Volatile Bullets is also not a very good tradeoff. You lose immediate damage in exchange for total damage, but even on Hazard 6x2 games with 4 players, there will usually not be enough targets for you to empty your ammo reserves, though that depends on your aim. The damage loss is too harmful to make more ammo valuable enough. Damage/ammo allows you to oneshot Mactera Spawn to the weakpoint without igniting them. It also allows you to oneshot ignited Spitballers, Grabbers, and Goo Bombers when hitting their weakpoints. You will very rarely run out of ammo with this build, and if you do, you likely are overwhelmed and have larger issues than being out of Bulldog shots. A recoil decrease is really not worth giving up an ammo or damage mod, especially considering that Volatile Bullets already has the near-pinpoint accuracy of the base Bulldog. If you need to spam shots, it's likely on a target that you can get close to, such as a Praetorian or Oppressor, or it's an enemy that you can afford to miss a few shots on, such as a Bulk that your team has spotted quickly. Verdict Take one ammo and one damage option. Tier 3 \u00b6 Super Blowthrough Rounds gives the Bulldog 3 blowthrough penetrations; Explosive Rounds gives you 30 area damage in a radius around the bullet, but halves your direct damage; and Hollow Point Bullets gives you +35% weakpoint damage bonus, for a total of 60%. This tier is pretty braindead. Why the hell anyone would take blowthrough on the Bulldog is beyond me. On the very rare chance that you manage to line up two enemy weakpoints, congratulations! You don't even have the weakpoint damage mod to make full use of your shot! If you want multikill potential on the Bulldog, take Explosive Rounds. Don't use this mod. While exploding bullets sounds like a decent pairing with Volatile Bullets, remember that this mod HALVES your direct damage, and explosive damage DOES NOT benefit from weakpoint damage. On top of that, you're still giving up the weakpoint damage bonus mod, which is a very powerful boost to pretty much any Bulldog build except Magic Bullets. Volatile Bullets benefits massively from an increased weakpoint multiplier. Verdict Take option 3 Hollow Point Bullets . Tier 5 \u00b6 The final tier for the Bulldog is sadly lacking in my opinion. We're given two fairly underwhelming options: Dead-Eye , which removes the penalty your accuracy receives when you move, and Neurotoxin Coating , which has a 50% chance to inflict Neurotoxin on enemies hit by a bullet. Dead-Eye is incredibly helpful when you need to hit a strafing shot, which ends up being pretty much any shot you're trying to make while not in a shield. If you're standing still, you're taking damage. While Neurotoxin is a decent status effect, on a heavy hitter like the Bulldog, it doesn't do much. This upgrade really only helps hit eventual breakpoints on targets like Trijaws or Acid Spitters, but you can simply pop them once with the Bulldog and then switch back to your primary and focus them for a couple milliseconds. The slow isn't powerful enough to be useful on larger targets, especially without the potential for Fearing bugs to get them to expose their weakpoints to you. Verdict Take option 1 Dead-Eye . Primary and Grenades \u00b6 As stated above, fire-based primaries are your best options. These include Burning Hell and/or Hot Bullets Lead Storm, or the Hurricane with Napalm-Infused Rounds . It also massively helps to have a CRSPR Driller, Inferno Breach Cutter / Incendiary Compound PGL Engineer, or White Phosphorus Boomstick Scout on your team. While the obvious choice is incendiary grenades, if you have a fire-based team composition these largely become redundant if you're using them solely for ignition, though they can still be handy for general swarm clear. Cluster grenades are another good option, as mentioned in my Burning Hell breakdown. Playstyle and Tips \u00b6 Volatile Bullets works best when you have a well-organized team, with players ready to ignite dangerous targets on command. This shines when you're communicating over voice with your teammates, and you're familiar with each others' playstyles. If you're in a public lobby, you will need to be much more aggressive with your ignitions to make the most of Volatile Bullets. If you're using a Hot Bullets minigun build that makes use of Magnetic Refrigeration on tier 1, try to apply multiple ignitions in one firing pass, then switch to Volatile Bullets and pop all the targets you've ignited. This will save time compared to pulling out the Bulldog after each ignition, then having to reheat the minigun. If you're using a Hot Bullets minigun build that DOESN'T make use of Magnetic Refrigeration , the minigun will usually stay heated long enough for you to switch to Volatile Bullets, shoot an enemy, switch back, and begin spinning the minigun again. However, sweeping over multiple targets while the minigun is hot is also a valid strategy here. Find what loop works best for you. Your aim, obviously, is a large factor in how effective you are with Volatile Bullets. If you find you can't hit an enemy's weakpoint (or you don't have an angle), it's still worth going for bodyshots on some enemies. 180 damage per bullet is nothing to scoff at. Target priority is quite important as a fire Gunner, as you have to manage which enemies are on fire at a given time. While DRG is a very situational game and target priority lists are context-sensitive, a general list I try to follow is this, in no particular order: Goo Bombers, Menaces, Grabbers, Menaces, Bulks, and Wardens. Praetorians and Oppressors can also become dangerous if not dealt with quickly in enclosed spaces, or on static objectives such as Salvage. Don't tunnel vision. Many times I find myself focusing on attempting to ignite a goo bomber that's haranguing a teammate across the map, while there are 6 slashers and an exploder walking up behind me. If you really need something ignited and dead, don't feel bad about shielding yourself. A dead Gunner is much worse than a Gunner that's down one shield who's now killed three or four dangerous enemies by himself. Utilize Born Ready to smoothly switch between igniting enemies and killing them. Ignite a couple targets, kill them, go about your day and wait for Born Ready to reload the Bulldog, repeat. Volatile Bullets targets are usually not so pressing as to demand that you manually reload, and if they are, you can shield.","title":"Volatile Bullets"},{"location":"builds/volatile-bullets/#build-breakdown-volatile-bullets-gunners-bulldog-overclock-modded-hazard-6x2","text":"Post Info Author u/Virryn__ Post Date 2022-06-14 Original Post Link BUILD BREAKDOWN: Volatile Bullets (Gunner's Bulldog) [MODDED: Haz6x2] One of Gunner's main roles in the Sticky Fuel composition is lots of single target damage against chunky enemies.

It also massively helps to have a CRSPR Driller, Inferno Breach Cutter / Incendiary Compound PGL Engineer, or White Phosphorus Boomstick Scout on your team. While the obvious choice is incendiary grenades, if you have a fire-based team composition these largely become redundant if you're using them solely for ignition, though they can still be handy for general swarm clear. Cluster grenades are another good option, as mentioned in my Burning Hell breakdown.","title":"Primary and Grenades"},{"location":"builds/volatile-bullets/#playstyle-and-tips","text":"Volatile Bullets works best when you have a well-organized team, with players ready to ignite dangerous targets on command. This shines when you're communicating over voice with your teammates, and you're familiar with each others' playstyles. If you're in a public lobby, you will need to be much more aggressive with your ignitions to make the most of Volatile Bullets. If you're using a Hot Bullets minigun build that makes use of Magnetic Refrigeration on tier 1, try to apply multiple ignitions in one firing pass, then switch to Volatile Bullets and pop all the targets you've ignited. This will save time compared to pulling out the Bulldog after each ignition, then having to reheat the minigun. If you're using a Hot Bullets minigun build that DOESN'T make use of Magnetic Refrigeration , the minigun will usually stay heated long enough for you to switch to Volatile Bullets, shoot an enemy, switch back, and begin spinning the minigun again. However, sweeping over multiple targets while the minigun is hot is also a valid strategy here. Find what loop works best for you. Your aim, obviously, is a large factor in how effective you are with Volatile Bullets. If you find you can't hit an enemy's weakpoint (or you don't have an angle), it's still worth going for bodyshots on some enemies. 180 damage per bullet is nothing to scoff at. Target priority is quite important as a fire Gunner, as you have to manage which enemies are on fire at a given time. While DRG is a very situational game and target priority lists are context-sensitive, a general list I try to follow is this, in no particular order: Goo Bombers, Menaces, Grabbers, Menaces, Bulks, and Wardens. Praetorians and Oppressors can also become dangerous if not dealt with quickly in enclosed spaces, or on static objectives such as Salvage. Don't tunnel vision. Many times I find myself focusing on attempting to ignite a goo bomber that's haranguing a teammate across the map, while there are 6 slashers and an exploder walking up behind me. If you really need something ignited and dead, don't feel bad about shielding yourself. A dead Gunner is much worse than a Gunner that's down one shield who's now killed three or four dangerous enemies by himself. Utilize Born Ready to smoothly switch between igniting enemies and killing them. Ignite a couple targets, kill them, go about your day and wait for Born Ready to reload the Bulldog, repeat. Volatile Bullets targets are usually not so pressing as to demand that you manually reload, and if they are, you can shield.","title":"Playstyle and Tips"},{"location":"data/","tags":["data"],"text":"Data \u00b6 This section collects posts that analyzes data for various aspects of the game, including but not limited to build breakpoints.

First off, there are some areas where BoM has a clear advantage. White phosphorus makes igniting big enemies very easy, so you should really never miss out on the 33% damage against praetorians, wardens, menaces, goo bombers, spitballers, breeders, grabbers, etc. And when you have the extra damage, BoM is going to do around 15% more DPS assuming all weakpoint hits (I'll address accuracy near the end). Oppressors don't stay on fire very long, but if you have IFGs it's easy to activate and even if you don't they're not an especially important enemy anyway. Where it really comes into question is smaller enemies where it's not worth the effort to ignite first and then switch weapons- a lot of these are going to die to the boomstick anyway, and if they don't it's a pretty time- and ammo-inefficient method of killing them. Most of these- mactera/trijwas and acid/web spitters, are also the targets that best fit under the general scout role in combat and are also very dangerous, so killing them quickly is important. You'd expect AISE to do better here, but it's actually a bit more complicated. The reason is that t5 stun lets the BoM player proc the extra damage just from shooting weakpoints, albeit probabilistically. I made this graph to show the percent difference in cumulative damage compared to BoM as the number of shots against a target weakpoint increases. For the first shot AISE has a clear advantage doing 14% more damage, but since just the 3rd BoM shot already has a higher expected value than the 3rd AISE shot, that deficit from the first two shots is basically gone by the 4th shot and past that BoM is doing more cumulative damage. The data in the graph is reproduced below, going up to 11 shots because the 12th shot may hit when stun has worn off, making things more complicated. Number of Shots BoM AISE BoM Cumulative AISE Cumulative Percent Difference 1 23.4 27.2 23.4 27.2 13.97 2 26.4888 27.2 49.8888 54.4 8.29 3 28.34208 27.2 78.23088 81.6 4.12 4 29.454048 27.2 107.684928 108.8 1.02 5 30.1212288 27.2 137.8061568 136 -1.33 6 30.52153728 27.2 168.3276941 163.2 -3.1 7 30.76172237 27.2 199.0894164 190.4 -4.6 8 30.90583342 27.2 229.9952499 217.6 -6 9 30.99230005 27.2 260.9875499 244.8 -6.6 10 31.04418003 27.2 292.03173 272 -7.4 11 31.07530802 27.2 323.107038 299.2 -8 So what does this mean? Against enemies with an adjusted health-after-weakpoint-modifier of ~100 or more (this includes already hurt larger enemies), BoM actually catches back up. Let's look at some specific enemies, again assuming no activators other than stun, and examine the breakpoints assuming weakpoint shots (or body shots for enemies where I don't think you can get wp shots consistently, but those are noted). This also assumes weakpoint damage and both damage upgrades, my preferred build for both, and uses haz 5 health numbers. Haz 6/7 health scaling will affect the large enemies, but those are ones for which breakpoints are less relevant, and will also generally favor BoM because longer strings of hits will benefit much more from stun. Enemy AISE BoM mactera spawn 3 shots 74% chance of 3 shots, 26% chance of 4 shots tri-jaw 6 shots 74% chance of 5 shots, 26% chance of 6 shots brundle 6 shots to break the armor, 9 more wp shots to kill 5 shots to break the armor, 40% chance of 8 shots to kill, 52.2% chance of 9 shots to kill, 7.8% chance of 10 shots to kill web spitter 1 shot (wp) 3 shots (body) 2 shots (wp) 3 shots (body) acid spitter 3 shots (wp) 9 shots (body) 74% chance of 3 shots (wp) 26% chance of 4 shots (wp) 8 shots (body) shellback 13 shots 15 shots (can't be stunned) goo bomber 6 shots to break the sacs, 51 to finish it off 6 shots to break the sacs, ~46 to finish it off grabber 10 shots 11 shots (can't be stunned) grunt 2 shots 3 shots slasher 4 shots 4 shots guard 6 shots 64% chance of 6 shots, 36% chance of 7 shots oppressor 50 shots 58 shots (can't be stunned) swarmer 2 shots 1 shot naedocyte 1 shot 1 shot exploder 1 shot 1 shot menace 20 shots 78.4% chance of 18 shots, 19.9% chance of 19 shots, 1.7% chance of 20 shots The menace should be taken with a grain of salt, as they burrow once they become unstunned requiring you to restun a second time. However, it's arguable that stun on a menace is more than valuable enough to make up for this. I also included a lot of enemies that you really should probably be igniting just for completeness' sake, though I also didn't include praetorians because they survive long enough for it to matter if the stun duration runs out, and there's a cooldown on reactivating it... it's a mess, but overall will still come out in BoM 's favor even just relying on stun, especially if you pause shooting during the stun cooldown. So based on these breakpoints it looks like BoM doesn't suffer that much. 1/4 of the time mactera spawn take an extra hit which is annoying, but trijaws take 1 fewer hit 3/4 of the time and are definitely the more dangerous of the two so there it's at least a wash. Both spitter types tend to show up in positions that make it very hard or impossible to hit their weakpoints, so imo BoM comes out ahead there. Some enemies have stun immunity, but they're also enemies that it's worth getting a status effect on so I don't think that has a big effect in game. So in terms of high value target elimination and assuming all weakpoint hits, BoM generally comes out ahead which may be unintuitive. Accuracy \u00b6 But AISE doesn't just increase the weakpoint modifier, it also eliminates recoil and increases spread recovery. Theoretically that could mean a higher percentage of weakpoint hits, and therefore more effectiveness against enemies with hard to hit weakpoints. But how important is it? If we first look at base gk2 with rate of fire holding down m1, we can see that there's a significant increase in spread very quickly , and when we compare to AISE with ROF it's clear that AISE is much more accurate. But now let's talk gyro stabilization. BoM with gyro stabilization actually has less spread than AISE until about 8 bullets in, though holding down m1 still has us getting out of hand by the end. But what if we fire in short bursts to stay in that accurate regime (and do some manual recoil compensation)? We can be very accurate , limited primarily by your ability to compensate for recoil rather than the spread of the weapon. And keep in mind that these tests are on a static target while not moving- in actual play the most significant factor is your own aim, after all even with infinitely accurate m1k focus shots I still miss weakpoints all the time, so once you get used to compensating for recoil the accuracy advantage from AISE disappears. Conclusion \u00b6 BoM is significantly better against large targets because igniting them or dropping an IFG on them is practically what you were going to do anyway. Both do roughly evenly against targets with no status effects at all, though it does depend on the specific target. Both have roughly even accuracy, though BoM definitely has a higher skill floor since if you can't compensate for recoil your shots will go all over the place, and you need to resist the urge to hold down m1 unless you're point blanking. BoM also does better if (or rather, when) you miss the weakpoint. AISE does 2 shot grunts and consistently 3 shots mactera spawn, which its main advantage besides being much easier to use. It's also generally better against dreads if you don't have a teammate consistently adding statuses, since you can't ignite and they don't tend to stay in IFGs very long. Of course this is mostly white-room optimization. While it does line up with my and others' experience, it doesn't conclusively prove that BoM is the better OC. Have you had other experiences, or disagree with my reasoning somewhere? Feel free to start a discussion in the comments.","title":"A look at GK2 Breakpoints with AI Stability Engine and Bullets of Mercy"},{"location":"data/gk2-bp-aise-vs-bom/#a-look-at-gk2-breakpoints-with-ai-stability-engine-and-bullets-of-mercy","text":"Post Info Author u/littlebobbytables9 Post Date 2022-05-29 Original Post Link A look at gk2 breakpoints with AISE and BoM These two OCs are largely considered the only two worth using for the gk2, but some people put AISE up on the same level as BoM while others do not and I wanted to explore the question quantitatively.

The slow from Electric can also be quite helpful against quick moving targets like Praetorians, and can keep Grabbers off your back longer than they otherwise would be. The main reason to take ULM is Bulks and Dreads. Dreads have Electric resistance, so there's no contest there. Against Bulks, there are plenty of team-wide options for consistently proccing both Electric (or IFGs) and Fire; almost any team worth their salt is likely to have one or the other, and more often than not they'll have one or more of each. In this department, the difference in ammo consumption and TTK between ULM and EGM is a gulf. If your team is bringing a Volatile Bullets gunner to be the designated Bulk shredder, you can take EGM and your conscience will be scot-free; but if you're the main weakpoint hammerer, you'll dearly miss having ULM . Consistency against lightly armored enemies depends largely on Armor Break. If one shot in the burst breaks an armor plate, the burst will usually consume one less ammo as long as one or more additional bullets in the burst hit the exposed plate. \u21a9 LOK-1 interacts strangely with guard heads. I'm unsure what the exact issue is, but if you attempt to kill them in two partial bursts, you have a small chance of your burst consuming an extra bullet.

From testing with the M1000 with the armor breaking upgrade, here's what happens: That specific armor plate has a right part and a left part. Both parts are unbreakable. The first M1000 shot ignores armor and does full damage. The armor is not broken. The second shot ignores armor and does full damage if you don't hit the same part. However if you do hit the same part you will do 20% reduced damage. Armor is still not broken by any shot. Subsequent shots do full damage if the part of the armor was not previously hit, and otherwise do reduced damage. The same bug affects slashers, web spitters, and acid spitters, and seems to affect all armor breaking weapons. I've personally had this bug happen most often (but still rarely) when using the M1000 on acid spitters, since they're usually above you and thus have their entire body visible. For the M1000 in particular, this bug affects the grunt breakpoints for any build that takes T1 ammo. However I wouldn't say it severely weakens these builds, since hitting 2 or 3 hipfire shots on the same piece of armor on a specific part of the body shouldn't happen often.

Why Difficulty Mods? \u00b6 Haz 5 has an upper limit when it comes to testing skill and builds. Past a certain individual skill level solo stops being interesting very quickly unless you attempt increasingly arcane self-imposed challenges like random builds, no-mod builds, and the like. You can do an ok job testing individual skill in multiplayer by carrying very poor teammates, but finding those teams is inconsistent and ultimately it's only a test of your individual skill. Ultimately, there is no way for haz 5 to test good teamplay, because a good team will steamroll any vanilla content put in front of them, so we have to turn to mods for missions where good teamplay is required. Similarly it's also hard to test builds in haz 5. Essentially any build with sufficient individual skill is enough to excel and even carry in haz 5, so it's difficult to test comparative statements about different builds. You can take builds or even team compositions entirely devoted to either single target or AOE with none of the other, and it doesn't have much of an impact on success rate simply because neither of those things are required to succeed in haz 5. Worse, even what \"good\" means is warped by the environment- if winning is practically guaranteed no matter what, builds or strategies that have high ceilings but require more setup or time end up looking impotent as everyone else kills all the enemies before you can execute- in the extremes, a \"kill stealing meta\" where having high kills on the score screen is seen as proof of a good build even if their contributions ultimately amounted to nothing, because contributing nothing isn't punished by vanilla content. So that's where difficulty mods come in, or at least the difficulty mods that we at r/technicaldrg are interested in (see the breakdown later in the post). They provide an environment that tests both individual skill and also teamplay in multiplayer. They provide an environment that makes it very obvious the differences in power level between builds. They require balanced compositions with strong single target and AOE. The good ones preserve vanilla balance as much as possible. And they're very fun to play. What they are not, ideally, is a power fantasy. While combining difficulty mods with other mods that buff weapons or make other changes is a perfectly legitimate way to play the game, here we focus on preserving the vanilla game as much as possible. All of the changes are there to make the game harder, with a few exceptions out of necessity: if you don't increase doretta health and reduce the nitra cost of resupplies it makes unfun failstates much too likely, much more likely than in vanilla. Doing this keeps balance aligned with vanilla while still making the game much harder/more skill testing. Therefore even if you're only interested in haz 5, the posts in this subreddit will still be valid. How to Use Difficulty Mods \u00b6 While there still exist standalone mods for some of these on mod.io, the Custom Difficulty mod has basically made them obsolete since it can reproduce any other difficulty mod while also allowing fine-grained control of any of the variables, changing difficulties without having to disband the lobby, changing resupply cost and enemy cap without additional mods, and many other advantages. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but Custom Difficulty is easy to use if you just copy-paste difficulty strings from this repo which has strings for many of the common difficulties like haz 6, 7, and 6x2. If it doesn't have a string for your desired difficulty and that difficulty exists as a standalone mod, you can simply enable both mods and Custom Difficulty will import the mod allowing you to save it as a new difficulty string. Custom Difficulty Presets Link: https://github.com/trumank/drg-custom-difficulties If you'd like to try your hand at modifying an existing difficulty, creating a new difficulty, or simply understanding what all these numbers mean, Virryn wrote a great guide to Custom Difficulty that you can read here . Custom Difficulty Guide Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/131FqOl0FnwiAslvvDSYkV35oBQXYx2kH0oZYwEpjoBI But I'll give special attention to the most important one here: The Enemy Count Modifier \u00b6 The common factor with nearly every difficulty mod is that they all increase the EnemyCountModifier field in the hazard file. This variable serves as a multiplier on nearly 1 all spawns in the game so turning it up means more bugs. Doubling it will cause twice the bugs to spawn, so if you ever see \"5x3\" or \"6x2\" that means taking the base difficulty, in this case haz 5 or haz 6, and then multiplying EnemyCountModifier by the multiplier. Example { \"EnemyCountModifier\" : [ 0.85 , // 1 player scaling 0.85 , // 2 players scaling 1.25 , // 3 players scaling 1.5 // 4 players scaling ], // ... } Enemy Cap \u00b6 The game has a limit on the number of enemies on the map at any one time, which by default is 60 swarmers and 60 enemies. Playing mods that increase the Enemy Count will quickly run into this cap, blunting the effect of the increased spawns. Playing even just 5x2 will feel very different with the vanilla enemy cap compared to a higher enemy cap, and if you want to play very high modifiers like 5x6 or 4x20 for the memes, you'll need to raise your cap extremely high. For most difficulties people actually play, though, a cap of [90, 120, 180, 180] is going to be sufficient, where the array goes from 1 player to 4 players. Example { \"MaxActiveEnemies\" : [ 90 , // 1 player scaling 120 , // 2 players scaling 180 , // 3 players scaling 180 // 4 players scaling ], // ... } Another cap that exists in the game is the enemy aggro cap. By default only 32 enemies can be aggroed on a given player at any time, so if you have more than 32 enemies on the map in a solo mission (or more than 128 enemies in a 4 player mission) then the other enemies just path around randomly until a slot opens up. Unfortunately, there is no way to change this with mods, at least not yet, and it means that very high multipliers become more frustrating than difficult, as once you fill the map with bugs they'll only come to you at a relatively slow but continuous trickle rather than all at once. Common Difficulty Mods \u00b6 A Path to Hazard 6x2 For people who have never played modded difficulties or are new to modded difficulties, a reasonable progression from Hazard 5 to harder difficulties (e.g. Hazard 6x2) is to play the following chain of difficulties, becoming more comfortable in each before progressing to the next difficulty: \\( \\text{Hazard 6} \\to \\text{Hazard 5x2} \\to \\text{Hazard 6x1.5} \\to \\text{Hazard 6x2} \\) Hazard 6 lets you become more familiar with increased enemy movement speed, more disruptive enemies, increased attack damage, and other stats that are changed from Hazard 5. Hazard 5x2 lets you become more familiar with larger swarm sizes. Hazard 6x1.5 is harder than Hazard 6, but still not as hard as Hazard 6x2, letting you become more familiar with larger Hazard 6 swarms. And finally is Hazard 6x2. Starship Troopers / Starship Troopers Elite \u00b6 The most common difficulty mod by far, starship troopers is equivalent to haz 4 with a x2 modifier and STE a x3 modifier. Haz 4 movement speed means that being able to kite is basically a cheat code and in combo with halfway reasonable AOE removes much of the difficulty. Hazard 5 with Multipliers \u00b6 The second most popular difficulty mod, most people play 5x2 with some 5x3 and the occasional 5xtoo much lobby. Many people view these as just AOE fests, which is mostly true. While increasing the enemy count modifier does lead to more bugs, making AOE better, it does also increases the number of menaces, mactera, praetorians, etc. so there is also an increase in the value of or need for single target damage. But haz 5 speed and damage means these difficulties are still pretty forgiving, so they can be a good intro to modded difficulties. Hazard 6 \u00b6 Finally the good stuff. A longer explanation from Ike himself is here, but the general idea is that Haz 6 started with a straightforward extrapolation from the jump from haz 4 to 5, and then was adjusted with the goal of making a fun higher difficulty that preserved the base game balance as much as possible. Note that some of the information in that document about what various difficulty fields do is wrong, refer to virryn's document to be safe. Enemy speed and damage is increased in haz 6, making kiting less effective (though still obviously useful) and punishing poor movement or being out of position. Large enemy health increases, and higher Enemy Diversity means a larger portion of the swarm is the more interesting enemies rather than just grunts. Stationary enemy spawn rates are kicked way up, much higher than a straight extrapolation, which makes different mission types feel very unique and further increases the value of single target damage. Overall ike did a good job making single target damage just as necessary as AOE clear. It's arguably more valuable, since you'll usually want at least 2 single target focused teammates while generally only needing 1 focused on AOE, though that's more a product of how each functions- twice as many grunts requires barely any more AOE to deal with, while twice as many menaces will require twice as much single target. This is the difficulty I would most recommend to people starting to get bored with haz 5. Hazard 7 \u00b6 7 is pretty much just more of 6. Even higher enemy speed and projectile speed makes it very punishing, especially with higher enemy damage on top. Very difficult and very much a test of individual skill- it's easy to die to haz 7 bullshit if you aren't 100% paying attention (and sometimes when you are lol). Slows, like that from sticky flames, become less effective since base move speed is so high, so to actually hold a position with sticky requires more lines or additional CC on top. Single target damage is arguably more important than AOE since there are so many special and disruptive enemies. Hazard 6x2 \u00b6 Haz 6 with a x2 multiplier. This is the hardest difficulty that is commonly played. Compared to haz 7 it has more but more forgiving enemies. Compared to 5x2 there is a much higher need for single target damage because of the swarm composition changes and the increase to stationary difficulty and enemy health, making it very balanced. In contrast to 7 it's more a test of team composition and synergy rather than individual skill (as much). Working effectively with your team and mastering group movement through the cave is very important. Hazard 5x2 Spicy Edition \u00b6 This one is new and actively updated, but aims to be a middle ground between 5x2 and 6x2 to aid in that adjustment (or allow more experienced players to play a similar difficulty with more room for not tryharding). Several variants exist at various points on the spectrum from 5x2 and 6x2. Hazard 7x1.5, 7x2, 6x3, etc. \u00b6 Steps up from 6x2, these difficulties are rarely played and require a solid team. 7x1.5 is the most comparable, generally being more punishing to mistakes but having a slightly smaller number of enemies compared to 6x2. If you're playing these you probably didn't need to read this post lol. Excludes regular brood nexus swarmer spawns, swarmer egg spawns, rival enemies, and dreads. \u21a9","title":"An Introduction to Modded Difficulties"},{"location":"guides/intro-modded-difficulties/#an-introduction-to-modded-difficulties","text":"Post Info Author u/littlebobbytables9 Post Date 2022-06-07 Original Post Link An intro to modded difficulties Since a lot of the posts in here are going to reference difficulty mods, I thought it would be good to have a quick overview of the various mods and the effect those have on gameplay.","title":"An Introduction to Modded Difficulties"},{"location":"guides/intro-modded-difficulties/#why-difficulty-mods","text":"Haz 5 has an upper limit when it comes to testing skill and builds.

It is recommended to change only the alternate keybinds, i.e. those with Index=1 .

(Note you can use other keybinds that allows you to cancel animation like Pickaxe or Previous Weapon, but LaserPointer is the most useful because 1) it does not cancel your sprint and 2) it pulls out LaserPointer which reveals the HUD). Take note here that the specific CustomKeyBinding entry you're editing has Index not equal to 0 and Key must be whatever key you have set for the Grenade keybind (Note: Although this guide says double binding, you can technically set multiple binds for a specific action; i.e., you have more than two CustomKeyBinds for a specific action. The CustomKeyBind you're editing just has to not be Index=0 to not edit the main keybind). Example: One of the keybinds to use my grenade is set to G .

Description by Virryn at How to Double Bind Grenade Cancelling in Deep Rock Galactic reproduced here: In-game, set your Grenade keybind to whatever you wish (for this example, MiddleMouseButton ). Find steam\\steamapps\\common\\Deep Rock Galactic\\FSD\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsNoEditor . Open GameUserSettings.ini in a text editor. Scroll down to CustomKeyBindings . Note that this will not display default keybindings; only actions with a custom keybinding (including manually unbound actions). This is under the [/Script/FSD.FSDGameUserSettings] section. Find or make CustomKeyBindings=(ActionName=\"LaserPointer\",Index=1,Key=???) . The Laser Pointer is most recommended, as it does not cancel your sprint and does not swap your weapon. Pickaxe and weapon swap are also viable; I am unsure what their exact ActionName s are. Index=0 means that keybind is the main keybind. Index=1 means an alternate keybind. It is recommended to change only the alternate keybinds, i.e. those with Index=1 . Set Key= to your Grenade keybind (which can be found under ActionName=\"Grenade\" ; for this example, MiddleMouseButton ) When pressed multiple times in quick succession, the middle mouse button should now quickly throw multiple grenades.

CustomKeyBindings = (ActionName=\"Grenade\",Index=0,Key=G) CustomKeyBindings = (ActionName=\"Grenade\",Index=1,Key=None) # Use Laser Pointer to grenade cancel; set alternative keybind to share the same keybind as # grenade toss.

Scroll down to CustomKeyBindings section. Edit the second CustomKeyBindings for LaserPointer : CustomKeyBindings=(ActionName=\"LaserPointer\",Index=1,Key=G) . If you don't have it, just make one. (Note you can use other keybinds that allows you to cancel animation like Pickaxe or Previous Weapon, but LaserPointer is the most useful because 1) it does not cancel your sprint and 2) it pulls out LaserPointer which reveals the HUD). Take note here that the specific CustomKeyBinding entry you're editing has Index not equal to 0 and Key must be whatever key you have set for the Grenade keybind (Note: Although this guide says double binding, you can technically set multiple binds for a specific action; i.e., you have more than two CustomKeyBinds for a specific action. The CustomKeyBind you're editing just has to not be Index=0 to not edit the main keybind). Example: One of the keybinds to use my grenade is set to G . Thus, I need to set the alternate key ( Index=1 ) for LaserPointer to the same key, G : CustomKeyBindings = (ActionName=\"Grenade\",Index=0,Key=G) ... CustomKeyBindings = (ActionName=\"LaserPointer\",Index=1,Key=G) So in my case, my primary keybind (Index=0) for grenade is R .
