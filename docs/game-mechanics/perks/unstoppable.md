**Unstoppable** is a *passive perk* that mitigates "**environmental slow-down effects**" and allows
you to walk faster while carrying heavy objects. The in-game description for the max tier
Unstoppable Perk states:

!!! quote "Unstoppable"

    Nothing holds you back! Environmental slow-down effects are reduced by 50%! You move 25% faster
    while carrying heavy objects!

The following is a list of effects that are considered "*environmental slow-down effects*" by
the game (non-exhaustive):

!!! warning "Incomplete List"

    This list is **incomplete**.

- Cobwebs
- Goo (both naturally generated, like in Fungus Bogs, and those produced by Goo Bombers)
- Heavy snow (naturally occuring in Glacial Strata)
- Storms (ice storms and sand storms)
- Earthquakes (like in Magma Core and Glacial Strata)
- Frost Praetorian Frost Spray

!!! error "Environmental?"

    The in-game description of the perk states "environmental" slow-down effects, even though some
    of these effects could be interpreted as "enemy-induced" slow-down effects.
