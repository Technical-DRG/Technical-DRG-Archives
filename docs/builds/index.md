# Builds

This section contains posts from [/r/technicaldrg](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicaldrg) which
recommend selected builds for the weapons of each class.

In each build post, the author typically lays out:

- Brief justifications for choosing the overclock.
- Recommended mod tier choices and *why* they are recommended over other mods of the same tier.
- Empirical and theoretical justifications for the overclock and recommended mod tiers.
- Strengths and weaknesses of the recommended build itself.
- Comparative advantages and disadvantages of choosing the build over other builds.

It is reasonable to find yourself using variants that disagree with the posts. If you would like to
initiate discussions surrounding the recommended overclock and mod tier choices, each archived post
contains a **Post Info** section that links back to the original
