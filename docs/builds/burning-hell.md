Gunner is a fairly straightforward class compared to the others, but he still has quite a few
versatile and flexible builds in his arsenal. Arguably his most powerful weapon is the Lead Storm
minigun, which can be built for simultaneous massive single target DPS and swarm clear with the
confusingly named Lead Storm overclock. This post, however, will focus on a more aggressive
playstyle: **Burning Hell**.

All numbers in this post are taken from the Equipment Terminal in-game.

!!! tip "TL;DR"

    **12223** or **32221** with **Burning Hell** are mostly your best options. Pair with
    [**Volatile Bullets**](./volatile-bullets.md) (Bulldog OC) for immense weakpoint damage and
    cluster grenades for a large on-demand area stun.

!!! info "Weapon Heat Crosshair Mod"

    I highly recommend the [Weapon Heat Crosshair mod](https://drg.old.mod.io/weapon-heat-crosshair)
    for any minigun build.

## Why Burning Hell?

While Lead Storm (or LSLS) is a very powerful overclock, it requires exceptional positioning skill,
decent aim, and is very unforgiving. Burning Hell is a much safer option, and if you can hit your
[Volatile Bullets](./volatile-bullets.md) shots, you don't lose out on much damage against chunky
targets. Burning Hell also has arguably more swarm clear potential than LSLS due to its ability to
ignite swarms much quicker and more easily, which allows fire spread to take effect faster.

## Tier 1

Our options on this tier are:

1. **Magnetic Refrigeration**, which doubles the minigun's base cooling rate when not firing and
reduces the cooling delay after the gun stops firing;
2. **Improved Motor**, which increases fire rate by 4, to a total of 34 bullets per second (though
the minigun's stats notoriously lie and the real firerate would only be 17); and
3. **Improved Platform Stability**, which reduces the gun's base spread from 100% to 25%.

A faster cooling rate makes maintaining Hot Bullets output much easier, as you need to wait for a
much shorter time before being able to tap-firing again without overheating.

Sadly, the increase in fire rate does not increase the heat produced by the minigun, which means you
unfortunately cannot take advantage of either Hot Bullets or Aggressive Venting faster.

Increased accuracy is very valuable on any fully automatic weapon.

!!! tip "Verdict"

    - Take option 1 **T1A MAgnetic Refrigeration** if you're choosing **Hot Bullets** on Tier 5.
    - Take option 3 **T1C Improved Platform Stability** if you're choosing **Aggressive Venting** on
      Tier 5.

## Tier 2

A somewhat boring tier, **Oversized Drum** adds 600 ammo to our pool, bumping us up to 3000, while
**High Velocity Rounds** increases our damage per bullet by 2, for a total of 12. This is a personal
choice, but it's important to note that Hot Bullets is affected by the damage upgrade; a fraction of
your total damage is ADDED as heat damage (not converted), and thus you will heat enemies faster if
you take the damage mod.

!!! tip "Verdict"

    Take either option. **T1B High Velocity Rounds** is recommended especially if you take
    **Hot Bullets**.

## Tier 3

Now we're getting to the good stuff. **Hardened Rounds** gives us 200% extra armor break, for a
total of 300%. **Improved Stun** gives us 20% extra Stun chance, for a total of 40%. **Blowthrough
Rounds** gives us one blowthrough penetration per bullet.

Armor break on a fully automatic weapon can be very useful, specifically against Shellbacks and
Brundles. However, since Burning Hell has low base damage and relies largely on its fire sources to
deal its full damage potential, this is not a great pick.

Stun helps make an already safe build even safer. It allows you to more reliably get up close to
bugs when needed, and also helps ensure that you hit [Volatile Bullets](./volatile-bullets.md) shots on targets with small
weakpoints, such as Menaces or Wardens.

Blowthrough is good on a direct damage build, but again Burning Hell relies on its fire capabilities
to do its damage. When playing close to the bugs, you will also typically not be at an angle to make
full use of blowthrough.

!!! tip "Verdict"

    While this is a personal choice, I strongly recommend option 2 **T3B Improved Stun**.

## Tier 4

Another interesting pick. **Variable Chamber Pressure** gives us a 15% damage boost when the gun is
fully stabilized (in other words, when you have reached max fire rate). **Lighter Barrel Assembly**
decreases the spinup time of the minigun from 0.7 to 0.3 seconds, and its opposite, **Magnetic
Bearings**, increases the time the minigun stays spun up by 1 second.

A 15% damage boost is nice for optimal damage on a direct damage build, but as mentioned previously,
Burning Hell gets much more use out of its fire and heat outputs. You will also almost never be
taking advantage of this mod while using your fire cone, as you need to be tap-firing to avoid
overheating.

Faster spinup helps this build immensely. First, you have a much more immediate reaction to danger
and can stun it very quickly if you need to. Second, a faster spinup allows you to keep continually
bringing up your fire cone more quickly, increasing your damage output at close range.

Honestly, I really don't know why Magnetic Bearings exists. You can manually tap your fire button
while not firing to keep the weapon spun up, and the other two options on this tier blow it out of
the water.

!!! tip "Verdict"

    Take option 1 **T4A Variable Chamber Pressure** if you think you'll make good use of it, but I
    recommend taking option 2 **T4B Lighter Barrel Assembly**.

## Tier 5

The most drastic playstyle changes found on the minigun are in this tier. **Aggressive Venting** makes
the gun explode when you overheat, producing large amounts of heat damage and Fear in a decent
radius around you, while also reducing the recovery time from an overheat in half, to 5 seconds from
10. **Cold as the Grave** cools the minigun slightly whenever it kills an enemy. **Hot Bullets**
adds 50% of your total damage to the weapon as heat damage.

Aggressive Venting is incredibly powerful in solo. Having an on-demand massive Fear bomb that also
burns enemies and thus produces fire spread is an extremely safe playstyle. Combined with the
quicker ignite that Burning Hell has, you can proc this incredibly quickly and quite often. However,
this playstyle isn't as effective in a team, as enemies that are targeting a teammate instead of you
will likely not get hit by the vent, and most classes will usually bring a better swarm clear option
to the team, rendering AV redundant.

Cold as the Grave is a popular choice, but Burning Hell benefits very little from it, and loses out
on a lot. I also don't believe that this mod procs when an enemy is killed from Burning Hell's fire
cone, which is the largest portion of your damage.

Hot Bullets is optimal for team play. It provides quick long range ignition on enemies, which is
powerful against Grunt packs because of fire spread, and is useful against tankier HVTS such as
Wardens and Menaces that you can finish off with a [Volatile Bullets](./volatile-bullets.md) shot or two.

!!! tip "Verdict"

    Take option 1 **Aggressive Venting** if you're running solo or in a team that can ignite far
    targets for you. Take option 3 **Hot Bullets** if you're in a team that you trust to deal with
    trash mobs so that you can focus on igniting targets for
    [**Volatile Bullets**](./volatile-bullets.md).

## Secondary and Grenades

As mentioned many times before, [**Volatile Bullets**](./volatile-bullets.md) Bulldog synergizes
exceptionally well with this build. It provides massive single target damage that you can easily
take advantage of with Hot Bullets. If you're using **Aggressive Venting** while solo, I would
recommend **Elephant Rounds** instead, as you won't be able to ignite far off targets easily
(barring incendiary grenades).

Cluster grenades and incendiary grenades are both competitive choices. Sticky grenades, IMO, don't
do enough swarm clear on their own for them to be worth it, even with their Fear potential. Clusters
can be used to wipe large groups of trash or as an on-demand large area stun button for Mactera.
Incendiaries have similar swarm clear to clusters, but they trade the stun potential for an instant
ignition source, which can be useful with [Volatile Bullets](./volatile-bullets.md).

## Playstyle and Tips

A Burning Hell Gunner needs to be on the ball with his [Volatile Bullets](./volatile-bullets.md)
shots. You need to be paying attention to what you and your teammates have ignited, are going to
ignite, and which heavy hitting enemies are currently on the playing field. Proper shield placement
has a high skill ceiling, but can be highly rewarding.

- Play close, but not too close. Corral the swarm; don't jump into the middle of it.
- If you have trash clearing teammates, such as a [Sticky Fuel](./sticky-fuel.md) driller, save your
ammo and use your fire cone for self defense against Naedocytes, rogue Swarmers, and small Grunt
packs. Save the larger clumps for classes who can deal with them more efficiently.
- Make use of both the cone and **Hot Bullets**, if you have it. You can b-hop and "dance" around
slightly in front of a swarm to allow yourself to heat them with the cone while not getting bitten
yourself. Pepper each enemy with a couple of shots and let the fire damage do the rest, rather than
trying to kill them one by one.
- If a large Mactera cloud appears, don't focus them down individually until they're dead. Attempt to
stun them instead, and keep rotating shots between them. Focus on stunning Trijaws first, as Spawn
and Brundles can be kited more easily.
- Don't feel bad about wasting ammo on Grunts or walls while trying to get to **Hot Bullets**. The
fire status effect and [Volatile Bullets](./volatile-bullets.md) will usually make up for the lost
damage.
- This goes for any Gunner playstyle, but try to use shields proactively, rather than reactively. A
team of 4 living dwarves can take advantage of a shield much more effectively than 3 dwarves trying
to revive someone who died because there wasn't a shield down. Shield before you're overrun, rather
than after.
