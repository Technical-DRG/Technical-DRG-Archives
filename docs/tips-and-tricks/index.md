# Tips and Tricks

This section collects some useful tips and tricks for Deep Rock Galactic. Many of these tips and
tricks may rely on ~~bugs~~ *unintended features* in the game that are introduced (and reintroduced)
in patches.

!!! warning

    Some of these tips and tricks are tied to new observable behavior that is introduced by
    patches, which can be patched or changed by newer patches without public announcements.
