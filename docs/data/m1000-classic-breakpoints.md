Interesting notes:

- **All** of these builds can: hipfire headshot grunts, focus shot headshot slashers, focus shot weakpoint shot Mactera Spawn.
- Armor Break is all but necessary to kill grunts efficiently.
- Taking damage and Killer Focus but **not** Armor Break is the only way to hit the focus bodyshot grunt breakpoint while missing the hipfire breakpoint.
- **If you have damage but not Armor Break, you can still 2x hipfire grunts IF the second hipfire hits where an armor plate was broken by the first shot**.
- The only way to leave a grunt alive after a headshot is by equipping Hipster.
- If taking ammo on tier 1, AB is required to bodyshot web spitters.
- Damage, AB and Killer Focus are all necessary to bodyshot acid spitters.
- Any combination of at least two of damage, Killer Focus, and weakpoint damage is required to kill Trijaws.
- Damage and weakpoint damage are both required to headshot acid spitters.
- All 4 damage mods will allow you to kill a Brundle in one focus shot and one hipfire shot to the weakpoint; missing one requires two focus shots.

## Weakpoint vs Blowthrough

Scaled to Hazard 6 with 4 players. Assumes all shots hit weakpoints. Primary number means number of
focus shots, additional number means hipfire shots. Build is **231XX**.

A **Hipster** breakpoints table was requested by u/littlebobbytables9, who also commented below with
one. I figured I'd incorporate a more lightweight version into this post.

Breakpoints:

- 1x Hipfire, Headshot, Grunt
- 1x Focus Shot, Bodyshot, Grunt
- 1x Hipfire, Body Shot, Web Spitter
- 1x Focus Shot and 1x Hipfire, Bodyshot, Acid Spitter

This table only applies to **Hipster** builds.

| Build | Grunt Focus Body | Grunt Hipfire Head | Web Hipfire Body | Acid Combo Body |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|

| 2-12X |                  | X                  |                  |                 |

Interesting notes:

- **All** of these builds can: 3x hipfire bodyshot grunts (no Hipster build can 2x hipfire them),
  focus shot weakpoint shot Mactera Spawn.
- If you take T1 ammo and no other damage mods, you will need 4 hipfires to kill a grunt (why would
  you ever do such a thing).
- Trijaws die in 1 focus shot and 1 hipfire shot to the weakpoint with **any** of these builds.
- Armor Break and Killer Focus are both necessary to kill acid spitters with 1 less ammo.
- The bug mentioned in [u/SheepHerdr's
  comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicaldrg/comments/wgboq3/comment/iiznwhy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
  below drastically affects the consistency of killing acid spitters in 3 hipfires; with damage and
  armor break it is possible, but you need to hit a different armor plate every time, which means
  you will usually end up needing 4 hipfires.

??? quote "u/SheepHerdr's comment on grunt, slasher, web spitter and acid spitter armor being slightly bugged"

    Original Link: <https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/wdchs5/back_armor_plate_on_grunts_unbreakable_with_m1000/iihk73o/>.

    From testing with the M1000 with the armor breaking upgrade, here's what happens:

    - That specific armor plate has a right part and a left part. Both parts are unbreakable.
    - The first M1000 shot ignores armor and does full damage. The armor is not broken.
    - The second shot ignores armor and does full damage if you don't hit the same part. However if
      you do hit the same part you will do 20% reduced damage. Armor is still not broken by any
      shot.
    - Subsequent shots do full damage if the part of the armor was not previously hit, and otherwise
      do reduced damage.

    **The same bug affects slashers, web spitters, and acid spitters, and seems to affect all armor
    breaking weapons.** I've personally had this bug happen most often (but still rarely) when using
    the M1000 on acid spitters, since they're usually above you and thus have their entire body
    visible.

    For the M1000 in particular, this bug affects the grunt breakpoints for any build that takes T1
    ammo. However I wouldn't say it severely weakens these builds, since hitting 2 or 3 hipfire
    shots on the same piece of armor on a specific part of the body shouldn't happen often.

- Damage and Armor Break are mandatory to bodyshot web spitters.
- With all 4 damage mods, it takes two weakpoint focus shots to kill a Brundle; lacking either
  Killer Focus or weakpoint damage requires an extra hipfire.
