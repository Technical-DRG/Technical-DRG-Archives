Interesting notes:

- **All** of these builds can: headshot grunts
- If an enemy is marked as dying to Fire WITHOUT Neuro, they will only have a sliver of health left
  after the final shot; in a live fire situation, this likely means the enemy has already taken
  enough damage during ignition for it to be instakilled.
- Patrol Bots are immune to Neuro.
- One damage mod is necessary to 2x bodyshot unignited grunts.
- Two of: damage, damage, and Hollow-Point is required to headshot unignited slashers OR Neuro alone
  (if it procs).
- One damage mod and Hollow-Point (or Neuro) is required to weakpoint shot unignited Mactera Spawn.
- Either a damage mod or Hollow-Point is necessary to 2x weakpoint shot unignited Trijaws.

## Elephant Rounds

**Elephant Rounds** Hazard 6, 4 player scaling shot count:

Assumes all necessary WP shots hit. Death to Neuro damage is denoted with +N. Body shots in a
weakpoint category are denoted as +x. N/A denotes a situation where the ammo and time sink meant
the potential kill was not worth it (aka I got lazy lol).

Interesting notes:

- **All** of these builds can: headshot grunts, bodyshot grunts, headshot slashers, headshot acid
  spitters, weakpoint shot Mactera Spawn and Trijaws.
- It takes both damage mods and a Neuro proc to bodyshot an acid spitter.
- Bulk weakpoints each pop in 2 shots regardless of your build.
